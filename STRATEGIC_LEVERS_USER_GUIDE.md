## Overview

The Strategic Levers System enhances the SCS Mediator simulation by adding **soft power dimensions** to complement numerical military parameters. This creates a more realistic model of diplomatic negotiations where success depends not just on military positioning, but also on:

- Diplomatic capital and influence
- International legitimacy and support
- Domestic political backing
- Credibility and reputation

### Key Benefits

**For Facilitators**:
- Richer debrief discussions about why teams succeed or fail
- Quantifiable soft power metrics to analyze
- More realistic escalation risk assessments
- Clear visibility into each party's strategic positioning

**For Participants**:
- Strategic actions that complement parameter adjustments
- Clear feedback on soft power positioning
- AI guidance that recommends both parameters AND strategic moves
- Realistic modeling of diplomatic constraints

---

## What Are Strategic Levers?

Strategic Levers are **high-level diplomatic actions** that affect both:
1. **Hard parameters** (military positioning, patrol patterns, etc.)
2. **Soft power metrics** (diplomatic capital, legitimacy, credibility, domestic support)

### Example

**Traditional Approach** (parameters only):
- "I'll set standoff=7 and escort=3"
- Effect: Reduces military tension

**Strategic Levers Approach** (hybrid):
- "I'll select 'Make Public Commitment to Peace'"
- Effect: Sets standoff=7, escort=3 AND gains +25 international legitimacy, -10 domestic support
- Result: Reduces military tension PLUS signals credible commitment (but costs domestic political capital)

#### Step 1: Navigate to AI Guidance Tab
- **Facilitators**: Select "Peacebuilding" tab → See AI Guide section
- **Participants**: Select your party → Click "AI Guidance" tab

#### Step 2: Ask Questions or Request Advice

**Example Questions**:

*General Strategy*:
- "What strategy should I pursue in this scenario?"
- "How can I reduce escalation risk?"
- "What are my negotiation priorities?"

*Parameter-Specific*:
- "Should I increase or decrease standoff distance?"
- "What prenotification level is optimal?"
- "How should I adjust patrol frequency?"

*Strategic Actions*:
- "Which strategic action should I take first?"
- "Should I propose joint development now?"
- "When is the right time to convene a summit?"

*Situation Analysis*:
- "My domestic support is low (35). What should I do?"
- "Why is my escalation risk so high?"
- "How can I build credibility?"

#### Step 3: Review AI Recommendations

The AI Guide will provide structured responses with:

**1. Academic Grounding**
```
📚 Putnam (1988) two-level game theory shows that your low domestic support (35/100)
constrains your win-set...

📚 Schelling (1960) suggests graduated reciprocation signals peaceful intent without
appearing weak...
```

**2. Specific Actions**
```
→ SIMULATION ACTION: Set standoff=7, escort=3, prenotify=8
💡 WHY: Reduces immediate military tension while maintaining deterrence posture

→ STRATEGIC ACTION: Click "Launch Track II Dialogue" button in Strategic Actions tab
💡 WHY: Low-risk way to build domestic support (+10) before costly concessions
```

**3. Quick Actions Summary**
```
QUICK ACTIONS SUMMARY:
- Parameter: standoff=7, escort=3, prenotify=8 (de-escalate military posture)
- Strategic Action: Launch Track II Dialogue (build domestic base)
- Strategic Action: Increase Transparency (boost credibility)
- Expected Result: Escalation risk drops from 42% to 34% (19% reduction)
```

#### Step 4: Implement Recommendations

**For Parameters**:
1. Go to "Negotiation" or "Propose Agreement" tab
2. Adjust sliders/dropdowns to recommended values
3. Submit proposal

**For Strategic Actions**:
1. Go to "Strategic Actions" tab
2. Find the recommended action card
3. Click "Apply Action" button
4. Observe effects on your strategic metrics

#### Step 5: Follow Up

Ask clarifying questions:
- "Why does Track II dialogue increase domestic support?"
- "What if the other party doesn't agree to these parameters?"
- "Should I sequence these actions or do them all at once?"

### Example Conversation

**Participant** (Philippines): "I'm stuck. The other parties won't accept my terms. What should I do?"

**AI Guide**:
```
Based on your current situation analysis:

CURRENT STATE ASSESSMENT:
- Your utility score: 45% (below target)
- Opponent likely to reject (acceptance probability: 25%)
- Your strategic position: Diplomatic capital 55, Legitimacy 50, Domestic support 65, Credibility 48

📚 Fisher & Ury (1981) "Getting to Yes" recommend expanding the pie rather than
splitting a fixed pie. Your current proposal treats this as zero-sum.

RECOMMENDATION 1: Build credibility before demanding concessions
📚 Osgood (1962) GRIT theory: Unilateral confidence-building initiatives signal
peaceful intent and create reciprocity
→ STRATEGIC ACTION: Select "Increase Military Transparency" in Strategic Actions tab
→ EFFECTS: +15 credibility (48→63), +10 legitimacy, +10 diplomatic capital
→ PARAMETER EFFECTS: prenotify=9, hotline→Dedicated
💡 WHY: High credibility makes your proposals more believable to opponents

RECOMMENDATION 2: Offer issue linkage
📚 Tollison & Willett (1979) show that cross-issue trades expand the bargaining space
→ SIMULATION ACTION: Increase their traditional_access to 75 while maintaining
revenue_split at 55 (favorable to you)
💡 WHY: They value fishing access more than revenue (different utility functions)

QUICK ACTIONS SUMMARY:
1. Strategic Action: Increase Transparency (build credibility first)
2. Parameter: traditional_access=75, revenue_split=55 (issue linkage)
3. Expected Result: Their acceptance probability increases from 25% to 65%
```

**Participant**: "Should I do both at once?"

**AI Guide**:
```
📚 Putnam (1988) suggests sequencing to manage domestic constraints

SEQUENCING RECOMMENDATION:
TURN 1: Increase Transparency
- Builds credibility with minimal domestic cost (0 change in domestic support)
- Signals peaceful intent before making concessions

TURN 2: Propose new parameters with traditional_access=75
- By now, higher credibility (63) makes your proposal more persuasive
- Traditional_access concession justified by earlier transparency move

💡 WHY SEQUENCE: Doing both simultaneously might appear desperate. Sequential moves
show strategic patience and strengthen causal narrative ("I've been transparent,
now I'm offering cooperation")
```

### Advanced AI Guide Features

#### Persistent Chat History
- Your conversation with the AI Guide persists throughout your session
- Scroll up to review earlier advice
- Build on previous discussions
- AI remembers context from earlier in the conversation

#### Dynamic Updates
The AI Guide automatically updates its recommendations as:
- You change parameters
- Your strategic metrics shift
- Other parties make moves
- The scenario evolves

#### Multi-Language Support
The AI Guide understands and responds to questions in:
- English
- Academic/technical terminology
- Casual conversational language

### Tips for Effective Use

#### Be Specific
**Less Effective**: "What should I do?"
**More Effective**: "My domestic support is 32 and dropping. Should I prioritize rebuilding it or should I make concessions now to reach agreement?"

#### Ask "Why"
Don't just implement recommendations blindly - understand the reasoning:
- "Why does joint development decrease domestic support?"
- "Why is credibility more important than legitimacy in this situation?"
- "Why does the AI recommend Track II dialogue before a public commitment?"

#### Request Alternatives
- "What if I can't afford to lose domestic support?"
- "Is there a lower-risk alternative to joint development?"
- "Can I achieve the same goal without spending diplomatic capital?"

#### Challenge Recommendations
The AI Guide is a tool, not infallible:
- "Won't increasing traditional_access make me look weak?"
- "How do I know the other party will reciprocate?"
- "This contradicts what I learned in class - can you explain?"

### What the AI Guide Can Do

✅ **Recommend specific parameter values** (e.g., "Set standoff=7")
✅ **Suggest strategic actions** with prerequisites and trade-offs
✅ **Explain academic theories** in accessible language
✅ **Analyze your strategic position** and identify weaknesses
✅ **Predict opponent reactions** based on utility functions
✅ **Sequence actions** for optimal timing
✅ **Troubleshoot problems** (low acceptance probability, high escalation risk)
✅ **Connect theory to practice** with 8-12 academic citations per response
✅ **Provide Quick Actions summaries** for easy implementation

### What the AI Guide Cannot Do

❌ **See other parties' strategies** (you don't have perfect intelligence)
❌ **Guarantee outcomes** (opponents have agency, uncertainty exists)
❌ **Make decisions for you** (you're the negotiator, AI is advisor)
❌ **Access information outside the simulation** (it doesn't know your instructor's grading rubric)
❌ **Bypass prerequisites** (if an action requires 40 domestic support, AI can't lower that)

### Common AI Guide Questions

**Q: Does everyone see the same AI recommendations?**
A: No! The AI Guide provides **personalized** recommendations based on YOUR party, YOUR strategic position, and YOUR current parameters. Philippines receives different advice than Vietnam.

**Q: Can instructors see my AI conversations?**
A: No. The instructor AI Guide and participant AI Guides are separate. Your conversations are private.

**Q: Will the AI Guide give me the "right answer"?**
A: Negotiation is complex - there's rarely one right answer. The AI Guide provides academically grounded options, but you must weigh trade-offs and make decisions based on your priorities.

**Q: Can I use the AI Guide during timed negotiations?**
A: Yes! That's one of its key features. It provides rapid guidance when you're under time pressure.

**Q: How often should I consult the AI Guide?**
A: Suggested frequency:
- **Beginning**: Ask for overall strategy
- **After each major change**: Get feedback on your adjustments
- **When stuck**: Request alternatives if deadlocked
- **Before finalizing**: Validate your final proposal

**Q: Does using the AI Guide count as "cheating"?**
A: No! The AI Guide is a built-in learning tool. In real diplomacy, negotiators have advisors, think tanks, and academic consultants. The AI Guide simulates this support system.

**Q: Can the AI Guide help with non-simulation questions?**
A: The AI Guide is focused on simulation strategy, but it can explain:
- Academic concepts (e.g., "What is prospect theory?")
- Historical cases (e.g., "How did the Gulf of Tonkin negotiations work?")
- Negotiation theory (e.g., "What's the difference between integrative and distributive bargaining?")

### Troubleshooting

**Problem**: "The AI Guide isn't responding"
**Solution**:
1. Check that you're connected to the internet
2. Verify the API server is running (instructors can check)
3. Refresh the page and try again

**Problem**: "The AI Guide gave me advice that didn't work"
**Solution**:
- AI provides probabilistic recommendations, not guarantees
- Check if you implemented all parts of the recommendation (both parameters AND strategic actions)
- Ask AI Guide for clarification: "I tried your advice but it didn't work. What went wrong?"

**Problem**: "The AI Guide's citations don't match what I learned in class"
**Solution**:
- IR theory has multiple schools (realism, liberalism, constructivism)
- Different theories may give conflicting advice
- Ask: "How would a realist approach this differently?" or "What would a constructivist recommend?"

**Problem**: "The AI Guide is being too cautious / aggressive"
**Solution**:
- Ask for alternatives: "What's a more aggressive strategy?" or "Is there a safer approach?"
- Specify your risk tolerance: "I'm willing to accept higher escalation risk for a better outcome"

### Integration with Strategic Levers

The AI Guide is fully integrated with the Strategic Levers system:

**Before Strategic Levers**:
- AI recommended only parameter adjustments
- No visibility into soft power dynamics

**With Strategic Levers**:
- AI recommends BOTH parameters AND strategic actions
- AI explains how strategic positioning affects escalation risk
- AI suggests sequencing (e.g., "Build domestic support first, then propose joint development")
- AI calculates expected impact (e.g., "This will reduce escalation risk from 42% to 34%")

**Example Enhanced Recommendation**:
```
Given your current strategic position (legitimacy 45, credibility 40, domestic support 52):

SEQUENCED STRATEGY:
Turn 1: Launch Track II Dialogue
- Strategic Effect: +10 domestic support (52→62), +5 credibility (40→45)
- Risk: Low
- Escalation modifier: 1.00x → 0.98x

Turn 2: Increase Transparency
- Strategic Effect: +15 credibility (45→60), +10 legitimacy (45→55)
- Risk: Low
- Escalation modifier: 0.98x → 0.92x

Turn 3: Make Public Commitment to Peace
- Parameter Effect: standoff=7, escort=3
- Strategic Effect: +25 legitimacy (55→80), -10 domestic support (62→52)
- Risk: Medium
- Escalation modifier: 0.92x → 0.82x

TOTAL IMPACT:
- Escalation risk: 42% (base) × 0.82 (final modifier) = 34.4% (18% reduction!)
- Strategic positioning: Strong (legitimacy 80, credibility 60)
- Domestic support: Back to 52 (sustainable)
- Cost: 3 turns, medium political capital

📚 This strategy follows Osgood's (1962) GRIT model: Graduated, Reciprocated
Initiatives in Tension-reduction, building trust incrementally
```

### Best Practices Summary

**DO**:
✅ Ask specific, context-rich questions
✅ Request academic justifications
✅ Challenge recommendations to understand trade-offs
✅ Implement both parameters AND strategic actions
✅ Follow up with "why" questions
✅ Use throughout your session, not just once

**DON'T**:
❌ Blindly follow advice without understanding
❌ Ignore strategic actions and only adjust parameters
❌ Expect perfect predictions or guarantees
❌ Use generic questions like "What should I do?"
❌ Forget to implement all parts of sequenced strategies

## For Facilitators

### Escalation Risk Assessment with Strategic Modifiers

When you assess a proposed action in the "Assess Proposed Action" section, you'll now see **4 key metrics**:

#### 1. Base Risk
The escalation probability from military parameters alone.

**Interpretation**:
- **0-20%**: Low risk (routine operations)
- **20-40%**: Moderate risk (heightened tensions)
- **40-60%**: High risk (dangerous brinkmanship)
- **60%+**: Critical risk (likely escalation)

**Example**: "Withdraw all troops from contested waters" = 20% base risk

#### 2. Strategic Modifier
How each party's soft power position adjusts the base risk.

**Calculation**: Average of all parties' strategic positioning
- Each party has 4 metrics (0-100 scale):
  - **Diplomatic Capital**: Ability to influence through diplomacy
  - **International Legitimacy**: Support from international community
  - **Domestic Support**: Public backing for negotiation strategy
  - **Credibility**: Reputation for following through

**Interpretation**:
- **<1.0 (green)**: Strong strategic positioning reduces escalation risk
  - Example: 0.85x = 15% risk reduction
- **=1.0 (orange)**: Neutral - strategic factors have no net effect
- **>1.0 (red)**: Weak strategic positioning increases escalation risk
  - Example: 1.25x = 25% risk increase

**Why It Matters**:
- High international legitimacy (>70) reduces risk by 15%
- Low credibility (<40) increases risk by 25% (opponent doesn't believe you)
- Low domestic support (<35) increases risk by 30% (forces hardline positions)
- High diplomatic capital (>70) reduces risk by 15%

#### 3. Final Risk
**The most important metric**: Base Risk × Strategic Modifier

This is the **actual escalation probability** combining hard military factors with soft power realities.

**Example**:
- Base risk: 40%
- Strategic modifier: 0.85x (good positioning)
- Final risk: 40% × 0.85 = 34%
- **Result**: Strategic positioning helped reduce risk by 6 percentage points!

**Use this number** when evaluating whether an action is too dangerous.

#### 4. Point of No Return
Whether the action crosses a critical threshold where de-escalation becomes extremely difficult.

**Based on**:
- Irreversible commitments
- Casualties or use of force
- Sovereignty violations
- Public humiliation or loss of face

**Interpretation**:
- **YES**: Action likely triggers dynamics that are very hard to reverse (sunk costs, audience costs, honor)
- **NO**: Diplomatic off-ramps still available

**Academic Basis**: Fearon (1994) on audience costs, Kahneman & Tversky (1979) on sunk cost fallacy

### Understanding the Metrics Section

Click the **"📖 Understanding These Metrics"** expandable section below the 4 cards to see:
- Detailed explanation of each metric
- Specific values from the current assessment
- Academic grounding for calculations
- Risk level interpretations

### Strategic Position by Party

Below the main metrics, you'll see a **party-by-party breakdown** showing each negotiating party's strategic modifier:

**Example Display**:
```
Strategic Position Impact by Party

🇵🇭 Philippines     🇨🇳 PRC Maritime     🇻🇳 Vietnam     🇲🇾 Malaysia
↓ 0.88x             = 1.00x               ↑ 1.15x         ↓ 0.95x
(green card)        (orange card)         (red card)      (green card)
```

**Interpretation**:
- **↓ Green**: This party's strategic positioning is helping reduce escalation
- **= Orange**: This party's position is neutral
- **↑ Red**: This party's weak position is increasing escalation risk

**Use Cases**:
- Identify which parties are helping vs hurting the situation
- Understand why similar parameter settings produce different outcomes
- Guide interventions during facilitation

### Debrief Discussion Points

Use strategic levers data to enrich debrief discussions:

**Question**: "Why did Team A succeed with similar military parameters to Team B?"

**Answer** (with strategic levers): "Team A built higher international legitimacy (75 vs 45) through strategic actions like 'Convene Regional Summit' and 'Increase Transparency'. This gave them a 0.85x strategic modifier, reducing their escalation risk from 38% to 32%. Team B focused only on military parameters and maintained neutral positioning (1.0x modifier), so their escalation risk stayed at 38%."

**Learning Point**: Soft power matters! Strategic positioning can amplify or dampen the effects of military parameters.

### Workshop Planning

#### Pre-Session Preparation
1. Review strategic actions available (see [Available Strategic Actions](#available-strategic-actions))
2. Prepare to explain strategic context metrics
3. Plan debrief questions around soft power dynamics

#### During Session
1. Monitor each party's strategic context in real-time
2. Note when parties make strategic moves
3. Observe how strategic modifiers change escalation risk
4. Track which parties are building vs depleting soft power

#### Post-Session Debrief
1. Display final strategic positions for each party
2. Compare strategic approaches across teams
3. Discuss trade-offs (e.g., domestic vs international support)
4. Analyze how strategic positioning affected outcomes

---

## For Participants

### Your Strategic Position Dashboard

In your participant view, navigate to the **"Strategic Position"** tab to see your party's soft power metrics:

#### Four Key Metrics (0-100 scale)

**1. Diplomatic Capital**
- **What it means**: Your ability to influence other parties through diplomatic channels
- **How it changes**:
  - Increases: Successful negotiations, Track II dialogues
  - Decreases: Organizing summits, offering incentives (costs resources)
- **Why it matters**: High capital (>70) reduces escalation risk by 15%

**2. International Legitimacy**
- **What it means**: Support from the international community and allies
- **How it changes**:
  - Increases: Public commitments, regional summits, joint development proposals
  - Decreases: Aggressive actions, violations of norms
- **Why it matters**: High legitimacy (>70) reduces escalation risk by 15%

**3. Domestic Support**
- **What it means**: Public and government backing for your negotiation strategy
- **How it changes**:
  - Increases: Track II dialogues, protecting sovereignty, avoiding concessions
  - Decreases: Joint development zones (seen as weakness by hardliners), public commitments
- **Why it matters**: Low support (<35) increases escalation risk by 30% (forces you into hardline positions)

**4. Credibility**
- **What it means**: Your reputation for following through on commitments
- **How it changes**:
  - Increases: Transparency, keeping promises, consistent actions
  - Decreases: Public commitments you can't keep, inconsistency
- **Why it matters**: Low credibility (<40) increases escalation risk by 25% (opponent won't believe your de-escalation signals)

### Strategic Actions Tab

In the **"Strategic Actions"** tab, you can select high-level diplomatic moves:

#### How to Use Strategic Actions

1. **Review Available Actions**: See which strategic actions are available based on your current position
2. **Check Prerequisites**: Some actions require minimum diplomatic capital or domestic support
3. **Understand Trade-offs**: Each action has costs and benefits
4. **Select Action**: Click to apply the strategic action
5. **Observe Effects**: See how both parameters AND strategic metrics change

#### Strategic Action Cards

Each action displays:
- **Name**: E.g., "Convene Regional Summit"
- **Type**: Diplomatic, Economic, Communication, Confidence-Building
- **Description**: What the action involves
- **Parameter Effects**: How it changes military parameters
- **Strategic Effects**: Impact on your 4 soft power metrics
- **Costs**: What you sacrifice (e.g., -20 diplomatic capital)
- **Risk Level**: Low, Medium, or High
- **Theoretical Basis**: Academic grounding (e.g., "Keohane (1984) institutionalism")

### AI Guide Integration

The AI Guide now provides **context-aware strategic recommendations** that include both parameter adjustments AND strategic actions.

**Example AI Response**:

```
Based on Putnam's (1988) two-level game theory, your low domestic support (45/100)
constrains your win-set...

RECOMMENDATION 1: Launch Track II Dialogue
📚 Diamond & McDonald (1996) show unofficial channels reduce risk while building relationships
→ STRATEGIC ACTION: Click "Launch Track II Dialogue" button in Strategic Actions tab
→ PARAMETER EFFECTS: prenotify=6, patrol_frequency=Monthly
→ STRATEGIC EFFECTS: +10 domestic support, +5 credibility
💡 WHY: Builds domestic coalition without requiring concessions that hardliners oppose

RECOMMENDATION 2: Then Increase Transparency
📚 Osgood's (1962) GRIT theory suggests unilateral initiatives signal peaceful intent
→ STRATEGIC ACTION: After gaining domestic support, select "Increase Transparency"
→ PARAMETER EFFECTS: prenotify=9, hotline→Dedicated
→ STRATEGIC EFFECTS: +15 credibility
💡 WHY: High credibility (58→73) will reduce escalation risk by 10% via modifier

QUICK ACTIONS SUMMARY:
- Strategic Action: Launch Track II Dialogue (build domestic base)
- Strategic Action: Increase Transparency (boost credibility)
- Final Result: Escalation risk drops from 38% to 30% (21% reduction!)
```

### Strategy Tips

#### Early Game: Build Your Base
- Focus on actions that increase **domestic support** first (Track II dialogues)
- Avoid costly actions (summits, joint development) until you have the capital
- Build **credibility** through transparency and consistency

#### Mid Game: Signal Intent
- Use **public commitments** to gain international legitimacy
- Balance domestic vs international support trade-offs
- Consider **economic incentives** if you have surplus capital

#### Late Game: Leverage Position
- Use accumulated **legitimacy** to reduce escalation risk
- **High credibility** makes your de-escalation signals believable
- **Diplomatic capital** enables final push for agreement

#### Common Mistakes to Avoid
1. **Ignoring domestic support**: Don't let it drop below 35 (forces hardline positions)
2. **Over-spending capital early**: Save diplomatic capital for critical moments
3. **Inconsistent messaging**: Low credibility undermines all your other efforts
4. **Only adjusting parameters**: Strategic actions amplify parameter effects

### Reading Your Strategic Impact

In the **"Peace Context"** tab, you can see how your strategic positioning affects escalation risk:

**Example Display**:
```
Your Strategic Impact on Escalation

Current Modifier: 0.90x (reducing risk by 10%)

Diplomatic Capital: 60 (Good)
International Legitimacy: 72 (Strong) ✓ Reducing escalation risk
Domestic Support: 48 (Moderate)
Credibility: 55 (Good)
```

**Green checkmarks** indicate metrics that are actively helping reduce escalation.

---

## Strategic Context Metrics

### Metric Scales

All strategic metrics use a **0-100 scale**:

| Score | Status | Color | Impact |
|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| 75-100 | Strong | Dark Green | Major positive effects |
| 60-74 | Good | Green | Moderate positive effects |
| 40-59 | Moderate | Orange | Neutral |
| 25-39 | Weak | Red | Moderate negative effects |
| 0-24 | Critical | Dark Red | Major negative effects |

### How Metrics Affect Escalation Risk

The system calculates a **strategic modifier** based on all four metrics:

```python
modifier = 1.0  # Start neutral

# International Legitimacy
if legitimacy > 70: modifier *= 0.85  # 15% reduction
if legitimacy < 30: modifier *= 1.20  # 20% increase

# Credibility
if credibility > 75: modifier *= 0.90  # 10% reduction
if credibility < 40: modifier *= 1.25  # 25% increase

# Domestic Support
if domestic_support < 35: modifier *= 1.30  # 30% increase (forced hardline)

# Diplomatic Capital
if capital > 70: modifier *= 0.85  # 15% reduction

final_escalation_risk = base_risk * modifier
```

**Key Insight**: Multiple metrics can compound. A party with high legitimacy (0.85x) AND high diplomatic capital (0.85x) achieves a 0.72x modifier (28% risk reduction!).

### Per-Party Independence

Each negotiating party has **independent strategic context**:
- Philippines government (PH_GOV)
- PRC Maritime forces (PRC_MARITIME)
- Vietnam Coast Guard (VN_CG)
- Malaysia Coast Guard (MY_CG)

**Why This Matters**: The same parameter settings produce different outcomes depending on each party's strategic positioning.

### System-Wide Calculation

When calculating overall escalation risk, the system:
1. Calculates each party's strategic modifier
2. Averages all party modifiers
3. Applies average modifier to base risk

**Example**:
```
Party Modifiers:
- Philippines: 0.88x (good positioning)
- PRC Maritime: 1.00x (neutral)
- Vietnam: 1.15x (weak positioning)
- Malaysia: 0.95x (slight positive)

Average Modifier: (0.88 + 1.00 + 1.15 + 0.95) / 4 = 0.995x ≈ 1.0x
```

## Available Strategic Actions

### 1. Convene Regional Summit

**Type**: Diplomatic
**Description**: Organize ASEAN/APEC summit to build multilateral consensus

**Parameter Effects**:
- hotline → Dedicated
- patrol_coordination → Info sharing
- prenotify = 8

**Strategic Effects**:
- Diplomatic Capital: -20 (costs resources to organize)
- International Legitimacy: +15 (gains support)
- Domestic Support: +5
- Credibility: +10

**Costs**: Requires significant diplomatic capital and time
**Risk Level**: Medium
**Prerequisites**: Minimum 30 diplomatic capital

**Theoretical Basis**: Keohane (1984) - Multilateral institutions reduce transaction costs and build trust

**When to Use**: Mid-to-late game when you have capital to spend and need legitimacy boost

---

### 2. Propose Joint Development Zone

**Type**: Economic
**Description**: Suggest shelving sovereignty disputes for resource co-development

**Parameter Effects**:
- revenue_split = 50
- moratorium_months = 12
- buffer_zone_nm = 15

**Strategic Effects**:
- Diplomatic Capital: +10
- International Legitimacy: +20 (major gain)
- Domestic Support: -15 (nationalists oppose)
- Credibility: +15

**Costs**: Domestic sovereignty concerns, nationalist opposition
**Risk Level**: High
**Prerequisites**: Minimum 40 domestic support (too risky otherwise)

**Theoretical Basis**: Deng Xiaoping's "shelving disputes, joint development" - Functional cooperation builds trust (Fravel, 2008)

**When to Use**: When you have strong domestic backing and need breakthrough on resource issues

---

### 3. Launch Track II Dialogue

**Type**: Confidence-Building
**Description**: Establish unofficial academic/business dialogue channels

## Understanding Escalation Risk Metrics

### Complete Explanation

After clicking "Assess Escalation Risk" in the instructor view, you'll see comprehensive metrics. Here's how to interpret them:

#### Base Risk Calculation

**Inputs**:
- Military parameters (standoff, escort, patrol patterns)
- Prenotification levels
- Current escalation level
- Historical actions

**Method**: LLM-powered assessment using Schelling (1960) escalation theory and Jervis (1976) spiral model

**Output**: Percentage probability of unintended escalation

#### Strategic Modifier Calculation

**For Each Party**:
1. Calculate individual modifier based on 4 metrics
2. Apply threshold effects (e.g., legitimacy >70 triggers bonus)
3. Compound multiple effects

**System-Wide**:
- Average all party modifiers
- Apply to base risk
- Result: Final escalation risk

#### Example Walkthrough

**Scenario**: Philippines proposes "Establish joint maritime patrol"

**Step 1: Base Risk Assessment**
- Action involves coordination (moderate trust required)
- Current escalation level: Level 3 (heightened tensions)
- Prenotification: 5 (moderate)
- **Base Risk**: 42%

**Step 2: Calculate Party Modifiers**

Philippines:
- Diplomatic Capital: 55 (moderate) → 1.0x
- International Legitimacy: 75 (strong) → 0.85x
- Domestic Support: 52 (moderate) → 1.0x
- Credibility: 68 (good) → 1.0x
- **Philippines Modifier**: 0.85x

PRC Maritime:
- Diplomatic Capital: 48 (moderate) → 1.0x
- International Legitimacy: 35 (weak) → 1.0x (not low enough for penalty)
- Domestic Support: 30 (weak) → 1.30x (penalty!)
- Credibility: 42 (moderate) → 1.0x
- **PRC Modifier**: 1.30x

Vietnam:
- All metrics moderate (45-55)
- **Vietnam Modifier**: 1.0x

Malaysia:
- All metrics moderate (45-55)
- **Malaysia Modifier**: 1.0x

**Step 3: Average Modifiers**
(0.85 + 1.30 + 1.0 + 1.0) / 4 = 1.0375x

**Step 4: Apply to Base Risk**
42% × 1.0375 = 43.6%

**Step 5: Interpret**
- Base risk: 42% (high risk - dangerous brinkmanship)
- Strategic modifier: 1.04x (slightly increasing risk)
- Final risk: 43.6% (high risk)
- **Why higher**: PRC's weak domestic support (30) is forcing them toward hardline positions, offsetting Philippines' strong legitimacy

**Actionable Insight**: PRC should take "Launch Track II Dialogue" to boost domestic support before joint patrols are viable.

### Point of No Return Analysis

**Triggers** (any of these):
- Use of force or casualties
- Permanent infrastructure on disputed features
- Declaration of sovereignty/ADIZ
- Public humiliation or loss of face
- Irreversible resource extraction

**Assessment Method**: LLM analysis of action description against trigger list

**Why It Matters**: Actions past this point trigger psychological and political dynamics that make de-escalation exponentially harder:
- Sunk cost fallacy (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979)
- Audience costs (Fearon, 1994)
- Honor and reputation concerns (Schelling, 1960)

## Best Practices

### For Facilitators

#### Pre-Workshop
1. Review all 6 strategic actions and their effects
2. Prepare examples of how strategic positioning affects outcomes
3. Plan debrief questions about soft power trade-offs

#### During Workshop
1. Monitor strategic context dashboards in real-time
2. Note when parties make strategic moves
3. Observe impact on escalation modifiers
4. Don't over-explain—let participants discover through gameplay

#### Post-Workshop Debrief
1. **Start with outcomes**: Which team achieved better agreement?
2. **Compare parameters**: Show how parameter settings were similar
3. **Reveal strategic positioning**: Show how different strategic approaches led to different outcomes
4. **Discuss trade-offs**: Highlight domestic vs international support tensions
5. **Connect to theory**: Reference academic sources for strategic actions taken

#### Discussion Questions
- "Why did Team A's public commitment reduce escalation more than Team B's parameter changes?"
- "How did low credibility undermine Team C's de-escalation efforts?"
- "What strategic actions could have prevented Team D's domestic support crisis?"
- "How did Team E's Track II dialogue create space for later joint development?"

### For Participants

#### Strategic Sequencing
1. **Build domestic base** (Track II dialogue)
2. **Establish credibility** (transparency, consistency)
3. **Gain international support** (public commitments, summits)
4. **Leverage position** (joint development, economic incentives)

#### Avoid Common Traps
- **Don't sacrifice domestic support early**: Hard to recover, forces hardline later
- **Don't make public commitments you can't keep**: Destroys credibility
- **Don't ignore soft power**: Parameters alone won't get you to agreement
- **Don't burn diplomatic capital**: Save for critical moments

#### Coordinate with Other Parties
- Share intentions: "I'm planning to propose joint development—will you support?"
- Sequence actions: "Let's both increase transparency first, then launch Track II"
- Build mutual credibility: Consistent actions across parties reduce escalation more

#### Balance Competing Pressures
- **Domestic vs International**: Joint development gains international legitimacy but loses domestic support
- **Short-term vs Long-term**: Public commitments cost domestic support now but build credibility later
- **Spend vs Save**: Summits cost diplomatic capital but gain legitimacy

## FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: Why add strategic levers? Aren't parameters enough?**

A: Real diplomacy involves more than just military positioning. Strategic levers model:
- Soft power (legitimacy, credibility, influence)
- Political constraints (domestic support)
- Strategic trade-offs (spending capital for legitimacy)
- Why similar parameters produce different outcomes

**Q: Is this too complicated for participants?**

A: No. Participants can start with just parameters and gradually incorporate strategic actions as they learn. The AI Guide provides specific recommendations for when to use strategic actions.

**Q: How accurate is the strategic context modeling?**

A: Strategic context metrics are simplified abstractions of complex political realities. They're designed to be:
- **Educationally valuable**: Teach core concepts about soft power
- **Strategically meaningful**: Affect outcomes in realistic ways
- **Grounded in theory**: Based on peer-reviewed IR research

They're NOT intended to be precise predictions of real-world dynamics.

### For Facilitators

**Q: How do I explain strategic modifiers to participants?**

A: Use concrete examples:
- "You have high international legitimacy (75), which reduces escalation risk by 15%"
- "Your low domestic support (30) is forcing you toward hardline positions"
- "Your credibility (45) means opponents are skeptical of your de-escalation signals"

**Q: Should I show participants the strategic modifier calculations?**

A: Optional. For advanced workshops, showing calculations helps participants understand mechanics. For introductory workshops, focus on intuitive explanations ("your strong position is helping").

**Q: What if strategic context makes negotiations unrealistic?**

A: You can adjust starting values in session state if needed. Default is all parties start at 50 (neutral). If you want to model a specific scenario (e.g., one party with low credibility), adjust accordingly.

**Q: How do I use strategic positioning in debrief?**

A: Compare final strategic positions across teams:
1. Show Team A's final metrics (e.g., legitimacy 75, credibility 70)
2. Show Team B's final metrics (e.g., legitimacy 45, credibility 50)
3. Discuss how these differences affected escalation risk and outcomes
4. Ask teams to reflect on strategic choices made

### For Participants

**Q: Should I prioritize parameters or strategic actions?**

A: Both! Strategic actions amplify parameter effects. Best approach:
1. Set parameters for your desired military/economic position
2. Use strategic actions to strengthen your soft power position
3. Result: Lower escalation risk and better negotiation position

**Q: How do I know which strategic action to use?**

A: Ask the AI Guide! It provides context-aware recommendations. Generally:
- **Early game**: Track II dialogue (build domestic support)
- **Mid game**: Transparency, public commitments (build credibility and legitimacy)
- **Late game**: Summits, joint development (leverage accumulated capital)

**Q: What if my domestic support drops too low?**

A: Low domestic support (<35) increases escalation risk by 30% and forces hardline positions. To recover:
1. Stop making concessions temporarily
2. Launch Track II dialogue (+10 domestic support)
3. Increase transparency (doesn't cost domestic support)
4. Wait for support to rebuild before proposing joint development

**Q: Can I see other parties' strategic metrics?**

A: No, each party only sees their own metrics (realistic - you don't have perfect intelligence). Facilitators can see all parties' metrics.

**Q: Do strategic actions cost turns?**

A: No, strategic actions are immediate. However, consider timing:
- Some actions require prerequisites (e.g., minimum capital)
- Actions have lasting effects on your strategic position
- Sequence matters (e.g., build domestic base before costly concessions)

### Technical Questions

**Q: How are strategic modifiers calculated?**

A: See [Strategic Context Metrics](#strategic-context-metrics) for detailed formulas. Key thresholds:
- Legitimacy >70: 0.85x modifier
- Credibility <40: 1.25x modifier
- Domestic support <35: 1.30x modifier
- Diplomatic capital >70: 0.85x modifier

Multiple effects compound (multiply together).

**Q: Why average party modifiers instead of multiplying them?**

A: Averaging ensures one party with poor positioning doesn't dominate the calculation. It's a democratic approach where all parties contribute equally to system-wide risk.

**Q: Can I customize strategic actions?**

A: Yes, for advanced users. Edit `src/scs_mediator_sdk/dynamics/strategic_context.py` and add new actions to `STRATEGIC_ACTIONS_LIBRARY`. Follow existing action structure.

**Q: Where is strategic context stored?**

A: In `st.session_state.strategic_contexts` dictionary, with one `StrategicContext` object per party. Each context tracks:
- 4 metrics (capital, legitimacy, support, credibility)
- Actions taken history
- Turn number

**Q: Does strategic context persist across sessions?**

A: No, strategic context resets when you refresh the page. For persistent sessions, use the session save/load feature (stores both parameters and strategic context).
