Shadowing and survey interference create safety and schedule risks. Malaysia balances revenue stability with quiet diplomacy and legalism. Stakeholder Landscape Domestic constituencies expect continuity of operations and calm. Legal & Normative Frameworks UNCLOS baseline: EEZ rights (Art. 56), enforcement (Art. 73). 2016 PCA Award: invalidates historic rights claims beyond UNCLOS entitlements. Operational norms: COLREGS (1972) and CUES (2014) to avoid collisions and miscalculation. Domestic overlays: detention powers, inspection procedures, and water-cannon usage policies. Drafting constraints: always include 'no prejudice to sovereignty' and humanitarian MEDEVAC carve-outs. Platform safety zones; environmental survey norms; dual-text statements for face. Operational Environment Approach thresholds (e.g., <3 nm) as triggers; AIS discipline near platforms; SAR readiness. Weather routing and maintenance windows; tug and support craft safety. Scenario Walk-Through & Decision Points Day 0: announce moratorium bounds; establish technical committee and AIS transparency near platforms. Day 10: neutral environmental survey commences; publish milestone plan. Day 30+: review against milestones and adjust scope. Mediation Toolkit & SDK Usage Offer vector knobs: duration_months, revenue_neutrality, AIS transparency level. Integrate dual-text communiqu\u00e9 to reduce face costs. Clause Library (Copy-Ready Text) Moratorium coordinates and exemptions; technical committee milestones; monthly AIS map publication. No-prejudice language; maintenance carve-outs. Monitoring, Verification & Dashboards Indicators: approaches <3 nm, incident count, milestone on-time %. Dashboards: approach-distance trend lines, milestone tracker. Reflection & Training Exercises Draw moratorium bounds that reduce risk without halting critical work. Design an AIS transparency protocol that protects sensitive data. How long should a moratorium last to be credible? ",
