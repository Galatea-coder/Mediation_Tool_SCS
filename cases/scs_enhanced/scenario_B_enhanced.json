    "background": "Historical & Geopolitical Context Scarborough Shoal is a key fishery; seasonal peaks create contact density with patrols and militia swarms. Patterns include rope-boom use, sideswipes, water cannon, gear confiscation allegations. Humanitarian and livelihood stakes increase the reputational cost of coercion. Stakeholder Landscape Local fishers (Zambales/Pangasinan), cooperatives, lenders; PCG units; PRC CCG/PAFMM. Legal & Normative Frameworks UNCLOS baseline: EEZ rights (Art. 56), enforcement (Art. 73). 2016 PCA Award: invalidates historic rights claims beyond UNCLOS entitlements. Operational norms: COLREGS (1972) and CUES (2014) to avoid collisions and miscalculation. Domestic overlays: detention powers, inspection procedures, and water-cannon usage policies. Drafting constraints: always include 'no prejudice to sovereignty' and humanitarian MEDEVAC carve-outs. Status-neutral corridor text; proportionality and non-lethal inspection standards. Operational Environment Corridor geometry: 1\u20133 nm lane width; lighting and speed rules; observers with EO cameras. Weather and seasonality calendar; media visibility practices. Scenario Walk-Through & Decision Points Day 0: observer scheme announced; hotline test; lane coordinates published. Day 3: first peak-contact day; monitor AIS compliance; respond to rumor with data. Day 7: mid-course review; adjust lane width or observer rotation. Mediation Toolkit & SDK Usage Offer vector knobs: lane_width_nm, observer_scheme, no_water_cannon, media protocols. Compensation fund triggers for temporary restrictions; debrief and iterate. Clause Library (Copy-Ready Text) Seasonal fisheries corridor with AIS-verified lanes; observer immunity; no water cannon clause. Hotline routing, dispute board (48h), and periodic review terms. Monitoring, Verification & Dashboards Indicators: catch volume vs baseline, harassment incidents, detention count. Dashboards: lane compliance heat map, observer report log, hotline uptime. Reflection & Training Exercises Calibrate a corridor that balances access and safety. Design an observer rotation that reduces harassment risk. Draft proportional inspection standards. How wide should the corridor be under high-swarm risk? Which observer model (NGO vs bilateral) best reduces misreporting? When should compensation be offered without moral hazard? Glossary & Acronyms EEZ \u2014 Exclusive Economic Zone; 200 nm from baselines. CUES \u2014 Code for Unplanned Encounters at Sea; confidence-building seamanship protocol. COLREGS \u2014 International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea. PAFMM \u2014 People\u2019s Armed Forces Maritime Militia. RHIB \u2014 Rigid-hull inflatable boat. BATNA \u2014 Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement. JFF \u2014 Joint Fact-Finding; rapid, time-bound evidence process. AIS \u2014 Automatic Identification System; tracking & collision avoidance. Annex: Data Sources & Further Reading Data pointers: ACLED (event-level), UCDP GED (conflict events), PA-X (peace agreements), PAM (monitoring provisions). Open satellite sources: Sentinel-1/2 (EO/SAR) via Copernicus; AIS public aggregators. Suggested practitioner reading lists and technical standards (COLREGS, CUES). ",
