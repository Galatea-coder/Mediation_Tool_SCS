    "background": "Historical & Geopolitical Context Indonesia enforces an UNCLOS EEZ near Natuna; PRC references traditional fishing grounds. Recurring incursions during peak seasons; detention spirals are the main escalation vector. Stakeholder Landscape Domestic legalists resist 'dispute' framing; preference for legal dialogue. Legal & Normative Frameworks UNCLOS baseline: EEZ rights (Art. 56), enforcement (Art. 73). 2016 PCA Award: invalidates historic rights claims beyond UNCLOS entitlements. Operational norms: COLREGS (1972) and CUES (2014) to avoid collisions and miscalculation. Domestic overlays: detention powers, inspection procedures, and water-cannon usage policies. Drafting constraints: always include 'no prejudice to sovereignty' and humanitarian MEDEVAC carve-outs. Detention notification norms and quick-release practices; mini-COC pilot zones. Operational Environment Shared patrol boxes; VHF/Hotline protocols; observer exchanges during fisheries peaks. Weather and visibility; AIS spoofing counter-measures. Scenario Walk-Through & Decision Points Day 0: publish patrol schedule; activate hotline; agree detention notification template. Day 5: observed incursion; use observer exchange; prepare joint release if detention occurs. Mediation Toolkit & SDK Usage Offer vector knobs: patrol calendar publication, detention notification SLA, observer exchange scope. Clause Library (Copy-Ready Text) Patrol schedule publication; detention notification timelines; joint release mechanism; safe lanes for fishers. Monitoring, Verification & Dashboards Indicators: detentions, incident rate, hotline drills pass rate, catch normalization. Reflection & Training Exercises Draft a mini-COC pilot for Natuna that avoids 'dispute' framing. What transparency measures reduce misreporting without revealing tactics? Glossary & Acronyms EEZ \u2014 Exclusive Economic Zone; 200 nm from baselines. CUES \u2014 Code for Unplanned Encounters at Sea; confidence-building seamanship protocol. COLREGS \u2014 International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea. PAFMM \u2014 People\u2019s Armed Forces Maritime Militia. RHIB \u2014 Rigid-hull inflatable boat. BATNA \u2014 Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement. JFF \u2014 Joint Fact-Finding; rapid, time-bound evidence process. AIS \u2014 Automatic Identification System; tracking & collision avoidance. Annex: Data Sources & Further Reading Data pointers: ACLED (event-level), UCDP GED (conflict events), PA-X (peace agreements), PAM (monitoring provisions). Open satellite sources: Sentinel-1/2 (EO/SAR) via Copernicus; AIS public aggregators. Suggested practitioner reading lists and technical standards (COLREGS, CUES). ",
