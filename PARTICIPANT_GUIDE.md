## Welcome

### What is This?

You're about to participate in a realistic mediation simulation based on real South China Sea maritime disputes. You'll negotiate with other parties to reach an agreement that satisfies everyone's interests.

### Your Experience

You'll:
- 🎭 **Play a Role**: Philippines, China, Vietnam, or Malaysia
- 🤝 **Negotiate**: Propose offers, respond to counter-offers
- 📊 **Get Feedback**: See how good agreements are for YOU (not others)
- 🎯 **Learn**: Experience realistic mediation dynamics

### What Makes This Realistic?

Just like real negotiation:
- ✅ You know your own interests and priorities
- ✅ You can see proposals on the table
- ✅ You know if offers are good FOR YOU
- ❌ You DON'T know other parties' exact satisfaction levels
- ❌ You DON'T see their internal priorities
- ❌ You must negotiate with incomplete information

This is how real mediation works!

## Understanding Your Role

### Each Party is Different

You're not just generic "Party A" and "Party B" - each role has:
- Unique **interests** (what you want to achieve)
- Unique **BATNA** (what happens if negotiations fail)
- Unique **concerns** (what keeps you up at night)
- Unique **constraints** (what limits your options)

### The Four Parties

#### 🇵🇭 Philippines Government

**Your Situation:**
You maintain a garrison on a grounded naval vessel (Second Thomas Shoal). You need to resupply them regularly, but China blocks and harasses these missions.

**Your Interests:**
- Keep your sovereignty claims alive
- Ensure safe passage for resupply missions
- Protect fishermen who work in these waters
- Avoid military escalation (you can't win a war with China)

**Your BATNA:**
Continue ad-hoc resupply missions with high risk of confrontation

**Your Concerns:**
- Safety of naval personnel
- National prestige (don't look weak domestically)
- Operational access to the area

**Your Constraints:**
- International law (UNCLOS) favors you, but enforcement is weak
- Domestic politics (public wants strong stance)
- US alliance (helpful but has limits)

**Negotiation Style:**
- You start from weak military position but strong legal position
- Focus on getting China to commit to procedures and verification
- Emphasize safety and predictability
- Willing to give on face-saving measures (media embargos, etc.)

---

#### 🇨🇳 PRC Maritime Forces

**Your Situation:**
You claim historical rights to South China Sea. Philippines' garrison on Second Thomas Shoal challenges your claims. You want to prevent normalization of their presence.

**Your Interests:**
- Assert your territorial claims
- Maintain strategic control over the waters
- Prevent Philippines from strengthening their position
- Avoid international condemnation (looks bad for China)

**Your BATNA:**
Continue blockade and harassment tactics to discourage resupply

**Your Concerns:**
- Strategic control of shipping lanes
- National face (Chinese public expects strength)
- Regional influence (other countries watching)

**Your Constraints:**
- International scrutiny (tribunal ruled against you)
- Regional relationships (don't want to alienate ASEAN entirely)
- Domestic nationalism (can't appear weak)

**Negotiation Style:**
- You negotiate from strong military position but weak legal position
- Focus on getting Philippines to limit their activities
- Emphasize your historical claims and security concerns
- Willing to give on operational details if strategic position preserved

---

#### 🇻🇳 Vietnam Coast Guard

**Your Situation:**
You have overlapping claims with both China and Philippines. You're worried about Chinese expansion and want to protect your fishing grounds and energy resources.

**Your Interests:**
- Protect traditional fishing grounds
- Secure oil and gas exploration rights
- Prevent Chinese expansion
- Maintain regional stability (you're not as strong as China)

**Your BATNA:**
Unilateral fishing patrols with high risk of confrontation with China

**Your Concerns:**
- Economic interests (fishing, energy)
- Security (Chinese encroachment)
- Regional balance (need ASEAN solidarity)

**Your Constraints:**
- Military limitations (smaller navy than China)
- Economic ties with China (complicated relationship)
- ASEAN cohesion (need regional support)

---

#### 🇲🇾 Malaysia Coast Guard

**Your Situation:**
You have claims in the southern part of the South China Sea, particularly around Natuna Islands and Kasawari gas fields. You want to maintain neutrality while protecting economic interests.

**Your Interests:**
- Protect EEZ boundaries
- Secure energy resources (natural gas)
- Maintain neutrality in regional disputes
- Economic development without conflict

**Your BATNA:**
Diplomatic protest with limited enforcement (you avoid confrontation)

**Your Concerns:**
- Energy security (gas fields are important)
- Economic interests (trade with China is huge)
- Regional relations (ASEAN chair role)

**Your Constraints:**
- Military capacity (modernizing but limited)
- Economic dependence on China (largest trading partner)
- ASEAN leadership role (must be neutral mediator)

---

## Your Interface

### Four Tabs

#### Tab 1: 📋 Your Position

**What's Here:**
- Your interests (what you want)
- Your BATNA (fallback option)
- Your key concerns
- Your constraints

**What To Do:**
1. **Read Everything Carefully**: This is your instruction sheet
2. **Identify Priorities**: What matters MOST to you?
3. **Understand BATNA**: This is your baseline - never accept worse than this
4. **Note Constraints**: What limits your flexibility?

**Key Insight:**
Your BATNA is crucial. It's your reservation point. The "utility" score (explained later) measures how much better an agreement is than your BATNA.

**Example:**
If your BATNA utility is 0 and an offer gives you 0.65 utility:
- You're 65% better off than your fallback
- This is a good deal!

If an offer gives you 0.35 utility:
- You're only 35% better off than fallback
- This is marginal - barely worth it

---

#### Tab 2: 📝 Current Proposal

**What's Here:**
- The latest offer on the table (from you or another party)
- Button to calculate YOUR utility from this offer

**What To Do:**

1. **Review the Proposal**:
   - Look at each issue area
   - Think about how it affects YOUR interests
   - Consider what you might change

2. **Click "🔍 Calculate My Utility"**:
   - The system calculates how good this offer is FOR YOU
   - You get two numbers:
     - **Your Utility**: 0-1 scale (higher = better for you)
     - **Your Acceptance Probability**: % chance you'd accept

3. **Interpret Results**:

   | Your Utility | Rating | Meaning | Your Decision |
   |--------------|--------|---------|---------------|
   | >0.7 | ✅ Excellent | Much better than BATNA | Accept! |
   | 0.6-0.7 | ✅ Good | Solidly better than BATNA | Accept |
   | 0.5-0.6 | 👍 Acceptable | Better than BATNA | Probably accept |
   | 0.4-0.5 | ⚠️ Marginal | Barely better than BATNA | On the fence |
   | <0.4 | ❌ Unacceptable | At or below BATNA | Reject or counter |

**Important:**
- You ONLY see YOUR utility, not other parties'
- This is realistic - in real negotiation, you don't know exactly how happy the other side is
- You must infer from their behavior and the facilitator's hints

---

#### Tab 3: 💭 Make Offer

**What's Here:**
- Sliders and controls to configure your proposed agreement
- Preview button to check YOUR utility before submitting
- Submit button to send offer to facilitator

**The Issues:**

**1. Resupply Operations** (left column)
- **Standoff Distance** (0-10 nautical miles):
  - Lower = More verification, less security
  - Higher = More security, less transparency
  - Philippines usually wants lower (easier resupply)
  - China usually wants higher (more control)

- **Max Escort Vessels** (0-5):
  - Fewer = Less threatening, more vulnerable
  - More = More security, more intimidating
  - Philippines wants more (protection)
  - China wants fewer (less militarization)

- **Pre-Notification Period** (0-48 hours):
  - Shorter = More flexibility, less predictable
  - Longer = More predictable, less flexible
  - Philippines wants shorter (operational flexibility)
  - China wants longer (ability to prepare/monitor)

**2. Communication Protocols** (middle column)
- **Hotline Availability**:
  - Ad-Hoc: Call only when needed (cheaper, less commitment)
  - 24/7: Always available (better crisis management, more commitment)

- **CUES Requirements**:
  - Safe Distance Keeping: Vessels maintain separation
  - AIS Transponders Active: Ships broadcast location
  - Incident Video Recording: Document all interactions
  - More = Better safety and accountability, but more constraints

**3. Media Management** (right column)
- **News Embargo Period** (0-48 hours):
  - Shorter = More transparency, less face-saving time
  - Longer = More time to craft narrative, less transparency
  - Useful for both parties to avoid immediate public pressure

**What To Do:**

1. **Start with Default Values**:
   - Middle of each slider
   - This gives you a baseline

2. **Adjust Based on Your Interests**:
   - Think: What do I care most about?
   - Example (Philippines): You need safe resupply
     - Increase escorts (protect your ships)
     - Decrease standoff (easier access)
     - Add CUES requirements (safety)

3. **Preview Your Utility**:
   - Click "🔍 Preview My Utility"
   - See: "Your utility from this offer: 68%"
   - This shows how good YOUR OWN offer is FOR YOU

4. **Think About Other Party**:
   - Is your offer reasonable?
   - Or are you asking for everything?
   - Remember: They have a BATNA too
   - If your offer is terrible for them, they'll reject

5. **Submit Offer**:
   - Click "📤 Submit Offer"
   - Facilitator will evaluate it
   - Other party will see it

**Strategy Tip:**
Your first offer can be ambitious (ask for a lot), but not ridiculous. If you start too extreme, you waste time. If you start too reasonable, you leave value on the table.

#### Tab 4: 📊 Your Strategy

**What's Here:**
- Text area to take notes
- Save button (saves in session only, not permanent)

**What To Do:**

Use this space to track:
- Your priorities: "Must have safe resupply, willing to compromise on escorts"
- Red lines: "Will NOT accept standoff >5nm"
- Observations: "China seems very concerned about military presence"
- Counter-offer ideas: "If they want longer embargo, I want 24/7 hotline"
- Progress: "Round 3 - getting close on resupply terms, still stuck on media"

**Example Notes:**

```
PRIORITIES:
1. Safe resupply (top priority)
2. Operational flexibility
3. National prestige (domestic politics)

RED LINES:
- Must be able to resupply at least monthly
- Must have some escort capability
- Can't accept "permission required" (that's surrender)

WILLING TO COMPROMISE:
- Exact escort count (1-2 is fine)
- Pre-notification time (12-24 hours OK)
- Media embargo (don't care much)

OBSERVATIONS:
- China very concerned about face
- Facilitator hinted China wants predictability
- Maybe I can give longer notification if I get more escorts?

ROUND 3 OFFER:
- Standoff: 4nm (compromise from my 3)
- Escorts: 2 (holding firm)
- Notification: 18 hours (increased from 12)
- Embargo: 12 hours (give them face-saving time)
```

## How To Negotiate

### The Process

**Round 1: Opening Offers**

1. **One party makes first offer** (usually whoever has initiative)
2. **Facilitator evaluates** (sees all utilities, doesn't reveal yet)
3. **Other party reviews** and calculates their own utility
4. **Other party responds** with counter-offer

**Rounds 2-4: Back and Forth**

1. **Review counter-offer**
2. **Calculate your utility**
3. **Decide**: Accept, reject, or counter
4. **If countering**: Adjust your offer slightly toward their position
5. **Submit new offer**
6. **Repeat**

**Key:** Each round, you should move closer. If you're stuck, the facilitator will provide hints.

**Convergence**

When utilities get close to acceptable for both:
- Facilitator may reveal numbers
- Agreement is tested in simulation
- Results show if it actually works

### Reading the Facilitator

The facilitator sees ALL utilities. They'll give hints:

| Facilitator Says | What It Means | What You Do |
|------------------|---------------|-------------|
| "Interesting proposal" | Neutral, gathering data | Wait for more feedback |
| "Party X seems satisfied" | Their utility is good | Don't need to give them more |
| "Party X has concerns" | Their utility is low | You need to give them something |
| "You're making progress" | Utilities improving | Keep going, same direction |
| "Think about issue Y" | That's where the gap is | Focus your concessions there |
| "Let's test this" | Both utilities acceptable | Agreement reached! |

**Important:** The facilitator WON'T say "increase escorts by 1" - they guide, not dictate.

### Typical Negotiation Arc

**Early Rounds (1-2):**
- Parties far apart
- Offers are ambitious
- Lots of back and forth
- Facilitator mostly observes

**Middle Rounds (3-4):**
- Parties narrowing gaps
- Facilitator provides hints
- Strategic concessions made
- Some issues resolved, others stuck

**Late Rounds (5-6):**
- Fine-tuning details
- Package deals ("I'll give on X if you give on Y")
- Facilitator more active
- Convergence or deadlock

**Resolution:**
- Agreement reached (both utilities >0.5)
- OR deadlock (can't find ZOPA - Zone of Possible Agreement)
- OR time runs out

## Strategy Tips

### Do's

✅ **Understand Your BATNA**
- Know your reservation point
- Never accept below 0.4 utility (below BATNA)
- But don't be greedy - 0.5-0.6 is usually good

✅ **Prioritize Your Interests**
- You can't win on everything
- Identify must-haves vs nice-to-haves
- Trade nice-to-haves for must-haves

✅ **Use "Preview My Utility"**
- Check before submitting
- Helps you understand the model
- Avoid proposing offers that are bad even FOR YOU

✅ **Take Notes**
- Track what you've learned
- Record patterns ("they always push back on X")
- Plan your next moves

✅ **Think About Their Interests**
- What do they care about?
- What can you give that costs you little but helps them a lot?
- "Efficient trades" = both sides gain

✅ **Be Willing to Move**
- Don't anchor on your first offer
- Each round, adjust something
- Show flexibility (but keep priorities)

✅ **Package Issues**
- "I'll give you longer notification if you accept lower standoff"
- Create value through combinations

✅ **Use Time Wisely**
- Don't rush - think through each offer
- But don't take forever - facilitator may move on

### Don'ts

❌ **Don't Reveal Your Utility**
- Keep your actual numbers private
- Just say "This offer doesn't meet my needs"
- Revealing exact utility gives away leverage

❌ **Don't Ignore Facilitator Hints**
- They're trying to help
- If they say "think about issue X", do it

❌ **Don't Be Greedy**
- If your utility is 0.75 and you're pushing for 0.85, you're risking the deal
- "Good enough" is often better than "perfect but fails"

❌ **Don't Make Tiny Incremental Moves**
- If you go from 5nm to 4.9nm standoff, you're wasting time
- Make meaningful adjustments

❌ **Don't Ignore Their Signals**
- If they keep pushing back on one issue, it's important to them
- You might need to concede there and get value elsewhere

❌ **Don't Forget the Simulation**
- An agreement that looks good on paper might fail in practice
- If facilitator shows simulation with high incidents, the agreement is weak

❌ **Don't Take It Personally**
- You're playing a role
- The other party isn't your enemy - you're both trying to solve a problem
- Stay professional

## Understanding the Numbers

### Utility Score (0-1 scale)

**What It Is:**
A mathematical measure of how satisfied you are with an agreement, based on:
- How well it meets your interests
- How it compares to your BATNA
- Loss aversion (losses hurt more than equivalent gains)

**How to Read It:**

| Score | Rating | Example | What You Should Do |
|-------|--------|---------|-------------------|
| 0.85 | ⭐⭐⭐ Excellent | "We get everything we wanted!" | Accept immediately |
| 0.65 | ⭐⭐ Good | "Solidly better than fallback" | Accept |
| 0.55 | ⭐ Acceptable | "Better than nothing" | Probably accept |
| 0.45 | ⚠️ Marginal | "Barely worth it" | Consider carefully |
| 0.35 | ❌ Poor | "Not really better than BATNA" | Reject or counter |
| 0.20 | ❌❌ Terrible | "Worse than fallback" | Definitely reject |

**Key Thresholds:**
- **0.4**: Your BATNA (your reservation point)
  - Above this: Agreement is better than your fallback
  - Below this: You're better off walking away

- **0.5**: Decent agreement
  - You're notably better off than your fallback
  - Reasonable to accept

- **0.6**: Good agreement
  - You're significantly better off
  - Strong case for acceptance

**Example:**
Philippines BATNA: "Continue ad-hoc resupply with harassment"
- Utility 0.38: This offer is barely better than current situation → Reject
- Utility 0.52: This offer is noticeably better than current situation → Consider
- Utility 0.68: This offer is much better than current situation → Accept

### Acceptance Probability

**What It Is:**
Based on your utility and risk attitude, what's the statistical likelihood you'd accept?

**How to Read It:**

| Probability | Meaning | What It Suggests |
|-------------|---------|------------------|
| >80% | You'd almost certainly accept | Strong offer |
| 60-80% | You'd likely accept | Good offer |
| 40-60% | Could go either way | Marginal offer |
| 20-40% | You'd likely reject | Poor offer |
| <20% | You'd almost certainly reject | Unacceptable offer |

**Relationship to Utility:**
- High utility → High acceptance probability
- But it's not 1:1 due to risk attitudes
- Some parties are risk-averse (accept easier)
- Some are risk-seeking (hold out for more)

**Why This Matters:**
- The facilitator sees acceptance probabilities for ALL parties
- Overall agreement probability = Product of all individual probabilities
- Example:
  - Your acceptance: 75%
  - Other party: 60%
  - Overall: 75% × 60% = 45% chance of agreement

**What You Should Know:**
- You only see YOUR acceptance probability
- Don't obsess over the exact number
- Focus on: Is my utility >0.5? Then probability will be decent.

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Anchoring Too Hard on First Offer

**What Happens:**
You make an opening offer, then refuse to move much from it.

**Why It's Bad:**
- Negotiation requires flexibility
- If you don't move, other party can't either
- You waste everyone's time

**Fix:**
Plan 3-4 rounds with decreasing demands:
- Round 1: Ambitious
- Round 2: Still favorable but more realistic
- Round 3: Balanced
- Round 4: Final concessions

### Mistake 2: Giving Away Everything

**What Happens:**
You move too quickly toward the other party's position.

**Why It's Bad:**
- You might accept a bad deal (utility <0.5)
- You signal weakness
- You leave value on the table

**Fix:**
- Check "Preview My Utility" before each offer
- Only move if you're still >0.5
- Make the other party work for concessions

### Mistake 3: Focusing on One Issue

**What Happens:**
You fixate on standoff distance and ignore everything else.

**Why It's Bad:**
- Value might be in other issues
- You miss package deal opportunities
- You signal what you care about (gives away leverage)

**Fix:**
- Review all issues each round
- Look for trades: "I give on X, you give on Y"
- Ask facilitator: "Are we stuck on the right issue?"

### Mistake 4: Ignoring the Simulation

**What Happens:**
You reach agreement (both utilities >0.5), then simulation shows 60 incidents and escalating trend.

**Why It's Bad:**
- Agreement won't actually work
- On paper, it looked fine
- In practice, it's too weak

**Fix:**
- Take simulation seriously
- If results are bad, the agreement needs strengthening
- Go back and add enforcement mechanisms

### Mistake 5: Playing to Win Instead of Solve

**What Happens:**
You treat it like a competition - trying to "beat" the other party.

**Why It's Bad:**
- Both parties need utility >0.4 or there's no deal
- "Winning" at negotiation means finding good outcome for both
- If you maximize your utility at their expense, they'll reject

**Fix:**
- Remember: This is mediation, not war
- The goal is an agreement that BOTH parties accept
- "Win-win" is possible through creative solutions

## FAQ

### Q: Can I see the other party's utility?

**A:** No. You only see your own. This is realistic - in real negotiation, you don't know exactly how satisfied the other side is. You must infer from their behavior and the facilitator's hints.

### Q: What if we can't reach agreement?

**A:** That's OK! Sometimes negotiations fail. This is a learning experience. In the debrief, you'll discuss why:
- Were both parties too rigid?
- Was there no Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA)?
- Did misunderstanding cause breakdown?
- What could have been done differently?

### Q: How do I know if my offer is reasonable?

**A:** Three checks:
1. Preview your OWN utility - is it >0.5? (good for you)
2. Think about their interests - does this address any of them? (good for them)
3. Watch facilitator reaction - do they say "interesting" (neutral) or "hm, Party X has concerns" (too one-sided)?

### Q: Should I accept the first offer above my BATNA (>0.4)?

**A:** Usually no. Just because an offer is "acceptable" (>0.4) doesn't mean it's good (>0.6). Negotiate further. But don't be too greedy - if you have 0.65 and you're pushing for 0.75, you might lose the deal.

### Q: What if I make a mistake?

**A:** No problem! This is training. If you submit an offer you regret:
- Tell the facilitator
- Explain what you meant to propose
- They can let you revise

### Q: Do I have to play my assigned role exactly?

**A:** Yes and no:
- **Yes**: You should advocate for your party's interests as described
- **No**: You have flexibility in HOW you negotiate
- Think of it as playing a character with clear motivations, but your own negotiation style

### Q: Why does my utility change when I adjust sliders?

**A:** Each issue has a weight (importance) for your party. Example:
- Philippines cares a LOT about resupply safety
- Philippines cares LESS about media embargo
- So: Changing standoff distance affects your utility MORE than changing embargo hours

The model weights issues based on each party's interests.

### Q: What happens after we reach agreement?

**A:** Facilitator will:
1. Reveal all utilities (you finally see everyone's numbers!)
2. Run simulation to test the agreement
3. Show incident counts, trends, severity
4. Discuss: Why did this agreement work (or not)?
5. Debrief: What did you learn?

### Q: Can I talk to the other party directly?

**A:** Depends on how the facilitator structures the session:
- **Isolated**: You only communicate via offers (like this interface)
- **Open**: You can discuss verbally while using interface
- **Mixed**: Some rounds isolated, some open

Ask your facilitator!

### Q: Is there a "right answer"?

**A:** No! Different agreements can work. The simulation tests durability, but there are multiple viable solutions. The goal is to learn the process of negotiation, not find the one perfect answer.
