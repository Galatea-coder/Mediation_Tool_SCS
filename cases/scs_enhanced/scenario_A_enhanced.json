    "background": "Historical & Geopolitical Context Second Thomas Shoal is sustained by periodic resupply to BRP Sierra Madre, making small-craft transfers sensitive to sea state and proximity. Incident patterns since 2024 show water-cannon usage, ramming/sideswipes, and interference near RHIB handoffs. Allied presence and media embeds increase visibility and time pressure. Stakeholder Landscape PH: PCG, AFP-WESCOM, NTF-WPS; fisher orgs; domestic political actors. PRC: CCG frontline, maritime militia swarms, PLAN overwatch; provincial maritime authorities. Legal & Normative Frameworks UNCLOS baseline: EEZ rights (Art. 56), enforcement (Art. 73). 2016 PCA Award: invalidates historic rights claims beyond UNCLOS entitlements. Operational norms: COLREGS (1972) and CUES (2014) to avoid collisions and miscalculation. Domestic overlays: detention powers, inspection procedures, and water-cannon usage policies. Drafting constraints: always include 'no prejudice to sovereignty' and humanitarian MEDEVAC carve-outs. Operational Environment Operational constraints: standoff distances, escort caps, RHIB box, weather windows (NE monsoon). Info discipline: AIS and video always on; agreed playback/exchange post-incident. De-confliction: hotline standard operating procedures and 48h JFF. Scenario Walk-Through & Decision Points Day 0\u20131: pre-notification; weather forecast; convoy composition review. Day 2: approach and standoff; potential shadowing; activate hotline. Day 3: RHIB transfer; camera/AIS logging; de-escalation if water cannon observed. Day 4: post-incident JFF and media protocol (6h embargo). Mediation Toolkit & SDK Usage Offer vector knobs: standoff_nm, escort_count, pre_notification_hours, hotline_status, embargo_hours. Interpret utilities vs acceptance; if below threshold, add verification/observers. Run sim to check incident frequency under current package; iterate. Clause Library (Copy-Ready Text) At-Sea Conduct (CUES-plus): distances, speeds, lighting, AIS/video on. Resupply SOP: \u22653 nm standoff, escort \u22641, prenotification 6\u201312h, RHIB box \u22641 nm radius. MEDEVAC pledge, JFF 48h, media embargo 6h, no prejudice to sovereignty. Monitoring, Verification & Dashboards Indicators: incidents/resupply, injuries, minutes-to-hotline, JFF closure time. Dashboards: incident histogram, timeline, and compliance scorecards. Reflection & Training Exercises Design a resupply SOP under rough-sea conditions. Negotiate a hotline upgrade from ad_hoc to 24/7 with verification exchange. Draft a media protocol that balances transparency and de-escalation. What standoff distance meaningfully reduces RHIB risk without ceding face? Which verification elements are feasible without implying adjudication? How does media latency change domestic pressure? Glossary & Acronyms EEZ \u2014 Exclusive Economic Zone; 200 nm from baselines. CUES \u2014 Code for Unplanned Encounters at Sea; confidence-building seamanship protocol. COLREGS \u2014 International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea. PAFMM \u2014 People\u2019s Armed Forces Maritime Militia. RHIB \u2014 Rigid-hull inflatable boat. BATNA \u2014 Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement. JFF \u2014 Joint Fact-Finding; rapid, time-bound evidence process. AIS \u2014 Automatic Identification System; tracking & collision avoidance. Annex: Data Sources & Further Reading Data pointers: ACLED (event-level), UCDP GED (conflict events), PA-X (peace agreements), PAM (monitoring provisions). Open satellite sources: Sentinel-1/2 (EO/SAR) via Copernicus; AIS public aggregators. Suggested practitioner reading lists and technical standards (COLREGS, CUES). ",
