## Introduction

### What This Manual Covers

This is a **complete participant reference** for the SCS Mediation Simulation. Unlike the quick guide, this manual:

- ✅ Explains **every piece of information** you'll see
- ✅ Details **every parameter** and what it means for YOU
- ✅ Provides **comprehensive negotiation strategies**
- ✅ Includes **all 4 party perspectives** in depth
- ✅ Covers **all metrics** and how to interpret them for your party
- ✅ Gives **scenario-specific guidance**
- ✅ Explains **what you know vs. what you don't know** (and why)

### Who Should Use This

- **Training Participants** negotiating as a party
- **Students** learning mediation and negotiation
- **Practitioners** preparing for real-world negotiations
- **Researchers** studying negotiation dynamics

### How This Differs from Real Negotiation

**What's Realistic:**
✅ You see your own position and interests
✅ You see your own utility from proposals
✅ You DON'T see other parties' exact satisfaction
✅ You must negotiate with incomplete information
✅ You face similar pressures (domestic politics, face-saving, time pressure)

**What's Simulated:**
⚠️ Utility scores are quantified (in real life, you estimate)
⚠️ Simulation shows what would happen (in real life, you don't know for sure)
⚠️ Time compressed (hours instead of weeks/months)

## Your Role Deep Dive

### Understanding the Four Parties

#### 🇵🇭 Philippines Government

**Your Official Position**:
"We maintain a lawful garrison on our territory within our Exclusive Economic Zone, as recognized by the UN tribunal. We seek peaceful, regular resupply of our personnel exercising our sovereign rights."

##### Your Real Situation

**Military Reality**:
- You have ~10 marines stationed on BRP Sierra Madre (a grounded World War II-era ship)
- Your navy is much smaller than China's
- You have US defense treaty but uncertain if it covers this shoal
- Cannot win military confrontation

**Legal Reality**:
- UN tribunal ruled in your favor (2016)
- China rejected ruling
- International law on your side but no enforcement mechanism
- UNCLOS clearly supports your EEZ claim

**Political Reality**:
- Domestic pressure to "stand up to China"
- Can't appear weak or give up garrison (political suicide)
- But also can't afford war
- Need to balance nationalist sentiment with pragmatism

**Economic Reality**:
- Fishing grounds important for livelihoods
- Not as economically critical as energy resources
- But symbolic value is high

##### Your Core Interests (Ranked by Importance)

**1. Safe, Regular Resupply (Weight: 40%)**
- **Why It Matters**: If garrison can't be resupplied, they must evacuate → you lose presence
- **What You Need**: Predictable, safe access at least monthly
- **Red Line**: Cannot accept "ask permission" model (undermines sovereignty)
- **Flexibility**: Can be flexible on how (timing, procedures) as long as it works

**2. Sovereignty Signal (Weight: 25%)**
- **Why It Matters**: Must show domestically and internationally you're not giving up claim
- **What You Need**: Agreement language that doesn't imply Chinese permission/control
- **Red Line**: Cannot accept terms that look like Chinese authorization
- **Flexibility**: Can accept "notification" but not "approval"

**3. Personnel Safety (Weight: 20%)**
- **Why It Matters**: Injuries/deaths would cause domestic crisis and possible escalation
- **What You Need**: Rules that reduce confrontation risk (distance, communication, escorts)
- **Red Line**: Cannot leave garrison vulnerable to harassment/injury
- **Flexibility**: More flexible on number of escorts than on safety protocols

**4. International Support (Weight: 15%)**
- **Why It Matters**: Need US, Japan, ASEAN to back your position
- **What You Need**: Agreement that upholds UNCLOS principles
- **Red Line**: Cannot undermine international law basis of your claim
- **Flexibility**: Can make practical accommodations as long as legal position intact

##### Your BATNA (Fallback Option)

**Current Situation if No Agreement**:
- Ad-hoc resupply attempts whenever weather/politics allow
- ~70% blocked or harassed by Chinese vessels
- 3-5 injuries per year from water cannon, ramming, lasers
- Constant risk of escalation
- High stress on garrison (psychological toll)
- International sympathy but no concrete support

**BATNA Utility**: 0.25 (pretty bad)
- Below 0.25 = Worse than current terrible situation → absolutely reject
- 0.25-0.40 = Marginal improvement → seriously question if worth it
- 0.40-0.60 = Meaningful improvement → consider accepting
- Above 0.60 = Significant improvement → strongly consider accepting

##### Your Negotiation Leverage

**Strengths**:
- ✅ International law on your side
- ✅ Tribunal ruling
- ✅ Moral high ground (smaller country defending rights)
- ✅ US alliance (though uncertain extent)
- ✅ Regional sympathy (other ASEAN countries worried about China too)

**Weaknesses**:
- ❌ Much weaker militarily
- ❌ More desperate (need agreement more than China does)
- ❌ Garrison is vulnerable
- ❌ Limited options if negotiation fails

##### Your Constraints

**Domestic Political**:
- Cannot appear to surrender sovereignty
- Public is nationalist on this issue
- Opposition will attack any "weak" deal
- But public also doesn't want war

**International Legal**:
- Cannot undermine UNCLOS basis of claim
- Need to maintain tribunal ruling's value
- Other disputes depend on this precedent

**Alliance**:
- Must keep US support
- US wants you to be "reasonable" not provocative
- But US also won't defend every shoal
- Need to show you're serious about defending territory

**Operational**:
- Resupply must work in practice, not just on paper
- Weather windows matter (typhoon season)
- Logistics are already difficult

##### Strategic Guidance for Philippines

**Opening Position Strategy**:
- Start ambitious but not ridiculous
- Emphasize sovereignty and safety, downplay face issues
- Show willingness to compromise on procedures, not principles

**What to Prioritize**:
1. **Must-Have**: Standoff ≤4 nm (can't resupply safely beyond this)
2. **Must-Have**: At least 1 escort (basic protection)
3. **Must-Have**: Pre-notification, not pre-approval
4. **Nice-to-Have**: More escorts, shorter notification, verification measures
5. **Don't Care Much**: Media embargo (can give this away easily)

**What to Trade**:
- Longer pre-notification (12-18 hours fine, prefer 8-12)
- Media embargo (give China face-saving time, doesn't cost you much)
- CUES video recording (prefer to have it, but can drop if needed)
- Exact escort count (1 vs 2 doesn't matter much)

**What NOT to Trade**:
- Standoff distance below 5 nm (operational necessity)
- Right to resupply (core sovereignty issue)
- Safety protocols (distance keeping, hotline)

**Negotiation Tactics**:
- Emphasize international law repeatedly
- Frame as "routine operations in our EEZ"
- Offer transparency (AIS, notification) to build confidence
- Avoid language of asking "permission"
- Be willing to give China face-saving measures (time, media)

#### 🇨🇳 PRC Maritime Forces

**Your Official Position**:
"China has indisputable sovereignty over the islands in the South China Sea and surrounding waters based on historical rights. The Philippines' illegal actions undermine regional stability. We maintain necessary maritime law enforcement to defend our rights."

##### Your Real Situation

**Military Reality**:
- You have overwhelming naval superiority
- Large coast guard fleet with bigger vessels
- Can blockade the shoal indefinitely if you choose
- Military escalation would be easy victory but brings international costs

**Legal Reality**:
- Tribunal ruled against you (2016)
- You rejected ruling as "null and void"
- "Nine-dash line" claim not recognized internationally
- But you don't accept UNCLOS jurisdiction over sovereignty disputes

**Political Reality**:
- Domestic nationalism very strong on this issue
- CCP legitimacy tied to "defending territory"
- Cannot appear weak or give in to "foreign pressure"
- But also need regional stability for Belt & Road, trade
- Xi Jinping personally invested in SCS policy

**Economic Reality**:
- Fishing rights matter but not critical
- Strategic control of sea lanes is the real prize
- Resources (oil, gas) are secondary
- Regional influence and preventing US encirclement are key

##### Your Core Interests (Ranked by Importance)

**1. Prevent Normalization of Philippines Presence (Weight: 35%)**
- **Why It Matters**: If resupply becomes routine, Philippines presence strengthens → bad precedent
- **What You Need**: Any agreement must not look like you're acknowledging Philippines' right
- **Red Line**: Cannot accept framework that implies Philippines sovereignty
- **Flexibility**: Can accept practical arrangements if framed as Chinese consent, not Philippines right

**2. Maintain Control/Sovereignty Posture (Weight: 30%)**
- **Why It Matters**: Domestic audience watching, CCP legitimacy, regional credibility
- **What You Need**: Must not appear to have "lost" or backed down
- **Red Line**: Cannot accept terms that look like Chinese surrender
- **Flexibility**: Can be flexible on actual terms if narrative/framing works

**3. Avoid International Condemnation (Weight: 20%)**
- **Why It Matters**: Need regional relationships for trade, BRI; want to avoid US intervention
- **What You Need**: Reduce incidents that generate negative press
- **Red Line**: Cannot accept framework that validates tribunal ruling
- **Flexibility**: Can make practical accommodations for "humanitarian" reasons

**4. Manage Domestic Nationalism (Weight: 15%)**
- **Why It Matters**: Public expects strong defense of "Chinese territory"
- **What You Need**: Agreement must be presented as China being magnanimous, not weak
- **Red Line**: Cannot accept deal that Chinese public will see as defeat
- **Flexibility**: Public doesn't care about technical details, only narrative

##### Your BATNA (Fallback Option)

**Current Situation if No Agreement**:
- Continue blockade/harassment tactics
- Successfully disrupt ~70% of resupply attempts
- International criticism but no concrete costs
- Maintain de facto control
- Risk of accident/escalation
- Some cost to regional relationships

**BATNA Utility**: 0.30 (not great but tolerable)
- Below 0.30 = Worse than current acceptable situation → reject
- 0.30-0.45 = Marginal improvement → question if worth compromising
- 0.45-0.60 = Meaningful improvement → likely accept
- Above 0.60 = Significant improvement → definitely accept

##### Your Negotiation Leverage

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Much stronger militarily
- ✅ De facto control of area
- ✅ Can sustain current situation indefinitely
- ✅ Less desperate for agreement
- ✅ Philippines needs agreement more

**Weaknesses**:
- ❌ International law against you
- ❌ Regional countries concerned about precedent
- ❌ US involvement risk
- ❌ Incidents generate bad press

##### Your Constraints

**Domestic Political**:
- Cannot appear weak or give in to Philippines
- Public is strongly nationalist
- Xi Jinping personally associated with SCS policy
- Social media amplifies nationalist sentiment

**Regional Strategy**:
- Need stable relationships for Belt & Road
- Trade with ASEAN countries important
- Want to appear as responsible power, not bully
- But cannot let this undermine other SCS claims

**International**:
- Must avoid triggering US intervention
- Cannot use lethal force (would bring international response)
- Want to avoid being labeled aggressor
- But also won't back down from "core interests"

##### Strategic Guidance for China

**Opening Position Strategy**:
- Start by emphasizing sovereignty, "magnanimous" accommodation
- Frame any concessions as Chinese choice, not Philippines right
- Show willingness to allow "humanitarian" access, not acknowledge legal access

**What to Prioritize**:
1. **Must-Have**: Narrative control (framing matters more than details)
2. **Must-Have**: Pre-approval or at least pre-notification (maintains control posture)
3. **Nice-to-Have**: Larger standoff distance (shows Philippines not "winning")
4. **Nice-to-Have**: Limits on escorts (reduced militarization)
5. **Don't Care Much**: Exact notification timing (12 vs 18 hours doesn't matter)

**What to Trade**:
- Exact standoff distance (as long as >4 nm, doesn't matter much)
- Communication protocols (24/7 hotline actually benefits you too)
- Some CUES requirements (you want safety too, reduces accident risk)

**What NOT to Trade**:
- Sovereignty narrative (cannot frame as Philippines' right)
- Some form of Chinese control (notification/approval)
- Appearance of losing (domestic backlash)

**Negotiation Tactics**:
- Emphasize you're being "reasonable" and "humanitarian"
- Frame Philippines garrison as "illegal" but you're willing to accommodate
- Offer practical solutions while maintaining sovereignty claim
- Give on substance, hold on narrative
- Use media embargo to control public perception

---

#### Tab 1: 📋 Your Position

**Purpose**: Understand your mandate, interests, and constraints

##### Section 1: Your Interests

**What You See**:
- Bullet list of 3-5 core interests
- Ranked by importance (usually)
- Specific to your party

**Example (Philippines)**:
```
🎯 Your Interests
- Maintain sovereignty over territorial waters
- Ensure safe passage for resupply missions
- Protect fishermen's livelihoods
- Avoid military escalation
```

**How to Use**:
- Read carefully - this is what you're negotiating FOR
- Prioritize: Top interests are more important
- **Think**: Which issues map to which interests?
  - Standoff distance → Safe passage
  - Escorts → Safe passage & show strength
  - Notification → Sovereignty (not asking permission)

**Strategic Insight**:
- Your utility function weights these interests
- Parameters that affect top interests matter MORE
- You can trade on lower-priority interests

---

##### Section 2: Your BATNA

**What You See**:
- Brief description of your fallback option
- What happens if negotiation fails

**Example (Philippines)**:
```
⚠️ Your BATNA
Continue ad-hoc resupply with high risk. In past year:
- 8 of 12 missions blocked or harassed
- 3 sailors injured (water cannon, laser)
- Increasing domestic pressure to either withdraw or escalate
```

**Why This Matters**:
- **BATNA = Your reservation point**
- Utility 0.4 = BATNA threshold
- Below 0.4 = Agreement worse than fallback → REJECT
- Above 0.4 = Agreement better than fallback → CONSIDER

**How to Use**:
1. Remember this description
2. When evaluating offers, ask: "Is this better than my BATNA?"
3. Don't accept below 0.4 utility (below your BATNA)
4. But don't be greedy - 0.5-0.6 is good if BATNA is bad

**Common Mistake**:
- Anchoring on ideal outcome instead of BATNA
- "I want 0.8 utility!" - but if your BATNA is 0.25, then 0.55 is actually very good

---

##### Section 3: Key Concerns

**What You See**:
- Bullet list of 2-4 major concerns
- What worries you about this situation

**Example (Philippines)**:
```
🔑 Key Concerns
- Safety of personnel
- National prestige
- Operational access
```

**How to Use**:
- These are dimensions your utility function captures
- Each parameter affects one or more concerns
- **Standoff distance** affects: Safety (lower = riskier feel) & Access (lower = easier ops)
- **Escorts** affects: Safety (more = better) & Prestige (more = strength)

**Strategic Thinking**:
- Can you address concerns without specific parameters?
- Example: Safety concern addressed by CUES requirements, not just standoff
- Prestige concern addressed by framing, not just escort count

---

##### Section 4: Constraints

**What You See**:
- Bullet list of 2-4 limiting factors
- Why you can't just do anything

**Example (Philippines)**:
```
🚧 Constraints
- International law (UNCLOS) - can't undermine legal basis
- Domestic politics - can't appear weak
- Alliance relationships - US wants you reasonable
```

**Why This Matters**:
- Explains why some options are off-limits
- Helps you understand your flexibility limits
- Guides what language/framing to use

**How to Use**:
- When tempted to accept bad deal: Remember constraints
- When offered something: Check against constraints
- **Example**: China offers good terms but requires "pre-approval"
  - Check constraint: "Can't appear to ask permission"
  - Problem: Pre-approval implies permission
  - Counter: "Pre-notification" instead

---

**Bottom of Tab 1**:
```
💡 Remember: Never accept an offer below your BATNA!
Aim for utility > 0.5 for a good agreement.
```

**Why This Note**:
- Reminds you of key threshold (0.4 = BATNA)
- Sets expectation (0.5 is "good enough")
- Prevents both being too lenient and too greedy

---

#### Tab 2: 📝 Current Proposal

**Purpose**: Review proposals on the table and assess them for YOUR party

##### Top Section: The Proposal

**What You See**:
- JSON display of current agreement terms
- Structured by issue area

**Example**:
```json
{
  "resupply_SOP": {
    "standoff_nm": 4,
    "escort_count": 1,
    "pre_notification_hours": 12
  },
  "hotline_cues": {
    "hotline_status": "24_7",
    "cues_checklist": ["distance", "AIS_on"]
  },
  "media_protocol": {
    "embargo_hours": 8
  }
}
```

**How to Read It**:
- Each top-level key is an issue area
- Values are the specific terms
- If no proposal yet, shows "No proposal currently on the table"

**What to Think**:
1. **Initial Gut Reaction**: Does this feel good or bad for you?
2. **By Issue**:
   - Resupply: 4 nm standoff, 1 escort, 12h notice
   - Comms: 24/7 hotline (good!), basic CUES
   - Media: 8h embargo
3. **Compare to Your Interests**:
   - Safe passage: 4 nm standoff reasonable, 1 escort is minimum
   - Sovereignty: 12h pre-notification (not approval) - acceptable
   - Safety: 24/7 hotline helpful, CUES basic but ok

**Don't Do Yet**:
- Don't calculate exact utility in your head (use the button)
- Don't commit to position yet (this is just review)

---

##### Bottom Section: Calculate Your Utility

**What You See**:
- Big button: "🔍 Calculate My Utility"
- After clicking: Two metric cards

**Button Purpose**:
- Sends proposal to backend
- Backend calculates YOUR utility from this proposal
- Returns YOUR utility and YOUR acceptance probability
- **You DON'T see other parties' numbers**

**After Clicking**:

**Metric Card 1: Your Utility**
```
🇵🇭 Philippines

Your Utility: 64%

✅ Good offer for you!
```

**What This Means**:
- You get 64% of way from BATNA to ideal
- 64% is GOOD (above 0.5 threshold)
- Color-coded:
  - Green (>60%): Good, should consider accepting
  - Blue (50-60%): Acceptable
  - Orange (40-50%): Marginal, at BATNA
  - Red (<40%): Below BATNA, should reject

**Metric Card 2: Your Acceptance Probability**
```
Your Acceptance Probability: 76%

Progress bar: [████████████████░░░░░░]
```

**What This Means**:
- Statistical likelihood you'd accept
- Based on your utility + your risk attitude
- 76% = You're likely to accept
- Not 1-to-1 with utility due to risk preferences

**How to Use These Numbers**:

**Utility 64%, Acceptance 76%**:
- This is a GOOD offer for you
- You should be satisfied
- Little room to push for more without risking deal
- **Decision**: Likely accept or propose minor tweaks

**Utility 45%, Acceptance 52%**:
- This is MARGINAL
- You're barely above BATNA
- Significant room for improvement
- **Decision**: Counter-offer with better terms

**Utility 35%, Acceptance 28%**:
- This is BELOW your BATNA
- You're worse off than your fallback
- This is a bad deal
- **Decision**: Reject or major counter-offer

---

**Strategic Insight: You Only See YOUR Numbers**

**What You See**:
- Your utility: 64%
- Your acceptance: 76%

**What You DON'T See**:
- Other party's utility: ??? (could be 75%, could be 35%)
- Other party's acceptance: ???
- Overall agreement probability: ???

**Why This Matters**:
- **Realistic**: In real negotiation, you don't know exactly how happy the other side is
- **Strategic**: You must infer from their behavior, facilitator hints
- **Learning**: Teaches you to negotiate with incomplete information

**How to Infer**:
- Facilitator says "Party X has concerns" → Their utility probably low
- Other party quickly accepts → Their utility probably high
- Other party pushes back hard on issue Y → That issue is important to them
- Facilitator says "you're making progress" → Gap is narrowing

---

#### Tab 3: 💭 Make Offer

**Purpose**: Configure and submit your counter-offer or proposal

**Layout**: Three columns for different issue areas

---

##### Column 1: 🚢 Resupply Operations

**What You See**:
```
🚢 Resupply Operations

Standoff Distance (nm)
[━━━━●━━━━━━] 4

Max Escort Vessels
[━●━━━━] 1

Pre-Notification (hours)
[━━━━━●━━━━━] 12
```

**Each Slider Explained**:

###### Standoff Distance (0-10 nm)

**What It Means**: How far away Chinese vessels must stay during resupply

**Your Perspective (Philippines)**:
- **Lower (0-3 nm)**:
  - ✅ Easier resupply (shorter distance)
  - ✅ Better verification of compliance
  - ❌ Feels less secure (Chinese ships close)
  - **Effect on Your Utility**: +0.15 to +0.20 per nm decrease from baseline (4 nm)

- **Higher (5-8 nm)**:
  - ❌ Harder resupply (longer distance)
  - ❌ Less verification
  - ✅ More security buffer
  - **Effect on Your Utility**: -0.10 to -0.15 per nm increase above baseline

**What China Cares About**:
- **Lower standoff**: Bad for China (appears to lose control, faces)
- **Higher standoff**: Good for China (maintains distance posture)

**Sweet Spot** (for Philippines):
- **3-4 nm**: Good balance
- Below 3: China will resist strongly
- Above 5: Your operations become difficult
- **Recommended Opening**: 3 nm (ambitious but not crazy)
- **Acceptable Range**: 3-5 nm
- **Red Line**: >6 nm (too difficult)

**Tactics**:
- If China offers 6-7 nm: Counter with 3 nm
- If China offers 4-5 nm: Consider accepting (close to sweet spot)
- If China offers 2 nm: You "won" but they'll reject (too one-sided)

---

###### Escort Count (0-5)

**What It Means**: How many Philippines military/coast guard vessels can escort resupply

**Your Perspective (Philippines)**:
- **0 escorts**:
  - ❌ Unacceptable (too vulnerable)
  - ❌ Looks weak domestically
  - **Effect**: -0.30 (major negative)

- **1 escort**:
  - ✅ Basic protection
  - ✅ Not overly provocative
  - ✅ Minimum acceptable
  - **Effect**: 0 (baseline)

- **2 escorts**:
  - ✅ Better protection
  - ✅ Shows some strength
  - ⚠️ China may see as militarization
  - **Effect**: +0.08

- **3+ escorts**:
  - ✅ Strong deterrent
  - ❌ Very provocative to China
  - ❌ China will strongly resist
  - **Effect**: +0.15 but China likely rejects deal

**What China Cares About**:
- **0-1 escort**: Acceptable to China
- **2 escorts**: China concerned about militarization
- **3+ escorts**: China will strongly oppose

**Sweet Spot** (for Philippines):
- **1-2 escorts**: Realistic range
- **Recommended Opening**: 2 (shows you want protection)
- **Acceptable**: 1 (if other terms favorable)
- **Red Line**: 0 (unacceptable)

**Tactics**:
- Escorts are often sticking point
- Consider: "1 escort normally, 2 in rough weather" (creative solution)
- If you give on escorts, get something back (better standoff, stronger CUES)

---

###### Pre-Notification Period (0-48 hours)

**What It Means**: How much advance notice you must give China before resupply

**Your Perspective (Philippines)**:
- **Short (0-6 hours)**:
  - ✅ Operational flexibility
  - ✅ Can respond to weather quickly
  - ❌ China suspicious (surprise attack?)
  - **Effect**: +0.08 per 6-hour decrease from 12h baseline

- **Medium (8-18 hours)**:
  - ✅ Good balance
  - ⚠️ Acceptable on all dimensions
  - **Effect**: 0 (baseline at 12 hours)

- **Long (24-48 hours)**:
  - ❌ Operationally constraining (weather may change)
  - ❌ Feels like asking permission
  - ✅ China feels respected
  - **Effect**: -0.06 per 6-hour increase above 18h

**What China Cares About**:
- **Short notice**: Bad for China (can't prepare, feels unilateral)
- **Long notice**: Good for China (preparation time, transparency)

**Sweet Spot** (for Philippines):
- **8-15 hours**: Ideal
- **Recommended Opening**: 8 hours
- **Acceptable**: 12-18 hours
- **Red Line**: >24 hours (too constraining)

**Tactics**:
- This is relatively easy to negotiate
- Good trading chip (doesn't cost you much to give 12 vs 8 hours)
- Consider: "12 hours standard, 6 hours emergency" (flexibility clause)

##### Column 2: 📞 Communication Protocols

**What You See**:
```
📞 Communication Protocols

Hotline Availability
[ ] Ad-Hoc  [●] 24/7

CUES Requirements
[☑] Safe Distance Keeping
[☑] AIS Transponders Active
[☐] Incident Video Recording
```

###### Hotline Availability

**Options**:
- **Ad-Hoc**: Call when needed, no dedicated staff
- **24/7**: Always available, dedicated operators

**Your Perspective (Philippines)**:
- **Ad-Hoc**:
  - ❌ May not be answered in crisis
  - ❌ Slower de-escalation
  - ✅ Less Chinese commitment (might be easier to get)
  - **Effect**: -0.08

- **24/7**:
  - ✅ Crisis management capability
  - ✅ Shows Chinese commitment to safety
  - ✅ Faster incident resolution
  - **Effect**: +0.08

**What China Cares About**:
- **Ad-Hoc**: Prefers (less formal)
- **24/7**: Acceptable (professional, responsible image)

**Recommendation**:
- **Always ask for 24/7**
- Not expensive for China
- Big benefit for safety
- Easy agreement point
- **If China resists**: Trade for something else (rare though)

---

###### CUES Requirements

**Three Options** (can select multiple):

**1. Safe Distance Keeping**
- **What It Means**: Vessels maintain 500-1000m separation
- **Your Benefit**: Reduces collision risk
- **China's View**: Neutral (professional standard)
- **Effect on You**: +0.10
- **Recommendation**: Always include

**2. AIS Transponders Active**
- **What It Means**: Ships broadcast their location continuously
- **Your Benefit**: Know where Chinese vessels are, verify compliance
- **China's View**: Negative (transparency loss, less tactical surprise)
- **Effect on You**: +0.12
- **Effect on China**: -0.08
- **Recommendation**: Try to include, but can trade if needed

**3. Incident Video Recording**
- **What It Means**: All parties record encounters
- **Your Benefit**: Evidence of Chinese behavior, accountability
- **China's View**: Very negative (evidence could embarrass them)
- **Effect on You**: +0.15
- **Effect on China**: -0.15
- **Recommendation**: Nice to have, but often need to drop for overall deal

**Strategic Approach**:
- **Minimum**: Distance only (both parties accept easily)
- **Standard**: Distance + AIS (good transparency)
- **Maximum**: All three (difficult to achieve)
- **Tactics**: Start with all three, be willing to drop video if needed

---

##### Column 3: 📰 Media Protocol

**What You See**:
```
📰 Media Management

News Embargo Period (hours)
[━━━●━━━━━━━] 8
```

**What It Means**: Delay before incidents can be publicly reported

**Your Perspective (Philippines)**:
- **0 hours (no embargo)**:
  - ✅ Transparency
  - ✅ Domestic support (show you're standing up)
  - ❌ Incidents escalate before de-escalation possible
  - **Effect**: -0.05 to -0.10

- **6-12 hours (short embargo)**:
  - ✅ Some coordination time
  - ✅ Not too restrictive
  - ⚠️ Neutral overall
  - **Effect**: 0 (baseline at 8h)

- **24+ hours (long embargo)**:
  - ❌ Appears to hide information
  - ❌ Domestic critics say "secret deal"
  - ✅ More de-escalation time (benefit minimal beyond 12h)
  - **Effect**: -0.08 to -0.12

**What China Cares About**:
- **No embargo**: Bad for China (no narrative control)
- **Short embargo (6-12h)**: Acceptable for China
- **Long embargo (24h+)**: Very good for China (full control)

**Strategic Value**:
- **This is a GREAT TRADING CHIP for you!**
- You don't care much about embargo
- China cares a LOT about it
- **Tactic**: Give China longer embargo (12h) to get something you care about (lower standoff, more escorts)

**Recommendation**:
- **Opening**: 6 hours (show you value transparency)
- **Acceptable**: 8-12 hours (good for China, doesn't hurt you)
- **Maximum**: 18 hours (beyond this, looks like hiding info)
- **Strategy**: Trade embargo hours for resupply terms

##### Bottom Section: Action Buttons

**What You See**:
```
[🔍 Preview My Utility]  [📤 Submit Offer]
```

**Preview My Utility Button**:
- **Purpose**: Check YOUR utility before submitting
- **What Happens**: Same as Tab 2 - calculates your utility
- **Use Case**: Make sure your offer is good FOR YOU before submitting

**Example**:
- You configure: Standoff 2nm, Escorts 3, Notification 6h
- Click Preview: "Your utility: 82%"
- Think: "This is great for ME, but China will never accept (too one-sided)"
- **Adjust**: Increase standoff to 3nm, keep escorts at 2
- Click Preview again: "Your utility: 68%"
- Think: "Still good for me (68%), more balanced, China more likely to accept"

**When to Use Preview**:
- Always before first offer (make sure you didn't misconfigure)
- When trying different combinations
- When you're unsure if changes help or hurt you

**Submit Offer Button**:
- **Purpose**: Send your offer to the mediator
- **What Happens**:
  - Offer saved to session state
  - Instructor can see it
  - Other parties can see it (in their Tab 2)
  - You cannot edit after submitting (would need new offer)

**Success Message**:
```
✅ Offer submitted to mediator! Waiting for response...
```

**What Happens Next**:
- Instructor evaluates your offer (sees ALL utilities)
- Other party reviews your offer (sees THEIR utility)
- Other party may:
  - Accept (if their utility good enough)
  - Reject (if below their BATNA)
  - Counter-offer (most common)

---

#### Tab 4: 📊 Your Strategy

**Purpose**: Take notes, track your approach

**What You See**:
```
📊 Your Strategy Notes

[Large text area]

Strategy & Notes:
What are your priorities?
What concessions can you make?
What are your red lines?
How is the negotiation progressing?

[💾 Save Notes]
```

**How to Use**:
- Track your thinking as negotiation progresses
- Document priorities, red lines, observations
- Note patterns in other party's behavior
- Plan your next moves

**Example Notes** (Philippines perspective):
```
ROUND 1:
- I proposed: 3nm standoff, 2 escorts, 12h notification
- My utility: 68% (good!)
- Facilitator said "China has concerns" - probably escorts too high

PRIORITIES:
- Must have: Safe resupply (<5nm standoff, ≥1 escort)
- Nice to have: 2 escorts, AIS transparency
- Don't care: Media embargo (can give this easily)

RED LINES:
- Standoff >5nm (can't operate safely)
- 0 escorts (too vulnerable, looks weak)
- "Pre-approval" language (sovereignty issue)

OBSERVATIONS:
- China very focused on face/narrative
- Facilitator keeps hinting media embargo important to China
- Maybe trade: I give longer embargo (12h→16h), China gives standoff (5nm→4nm)?

ROUND 2 PLAN:
- Offer: 4nm standoff, 1 escort, 12h notification, 12h embargo
- Drop 1 escort (from 2→1) to show flexibility
- Keep standoff at 4nm (critical for ops)
- Increase embargo to 12h (give China face)
```

**Why This Helps**:
- Keeps you organized across multiple rounds
- Helps you remember what you learned
- Plans your strategy systematically
- **Shows instructor** you're thinking strategically (if they can see)

**Tips**:
- Update after each round
- Note both hard data and soft signals
- Think ahead to next move
- Document your reasoning (learning exercise)

## Understanding All Parameters

### Deep Dive: How Each Parameter Affects Your Utility

Your utility is calculated using **Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT)**. Here's exactly how each parameter affects YOU.

#### Utility Calculation Formula

```
Your_Utility = Σ (Issue_Weight × Parameter_Weight × Parameter_Value)
```

**Example** (Philippines on resupply SOP):
```
Resupply SOP weight: 0.40 (40% of total utility)

Within Resupply SOP:
- Standoff distance weight: 0.50 (50% of resupply utility)
- Escort count weight: 0.30 (30% of resupply utility)
- Notification time weight: 0.20 (20% of resupply utility)

If agreement has:
- Standoff 3nm → Value 0.70 for Philippines
- Escorts 2 → Value 0.60 for Philippines
- Notification 12h → Value 0.50 for Philippines

Contribution to total utility:
- Standoff: 0.40 × 0.50 × 0.70 = 0.14
- Escorts: 0.40 × 0.30 × 0.60 = 0.072
- Notification: 0.40 × 0.20 × 0.50 = 0.040

Resupply SOP total: 0.14 + 0.072 + 0.040 = 0.252
```

Repeat for other issues (hotline, media), sum up = Total utility

---

### Parameter Value Functions

**How slider values map to utility**:

#### Philippines: Standoff Distance

**Preference**: Lower is better (easier operations)

**Value Function**:
```
standoff_nm | Value | Marginal Change
0           | 1.00  | -
1           | 0.90  | -0.10
2           | 0.80  | -0.10
3           | 0.70  | -0.10
4           | 0.60  | -0.10
5           | 0.50  | -0.10
6           | 0.35  | -0.15 (steeper decline)
7           | 0.20  | -0.15
8           | 0.05  | -0.15
9-10        | 0.00  | (infeasible)
```

**Interpretation**:
- Each nm from 0-5: Costs you -0.10 value
- Each nm from 6-8: Costs you -0.15 value (worse!)
- **Why steeper above 5nm**: Operations become impractical

**Strategic Implication**:
- Going from 4nm to 5nm: Costs 0.10 value
- Going from 5nm to 6nm: Costs 0.15 value
- **Fight harder to stay below 5nm** (diminishing returns set in)

---

#### Philippines: Escort Count

**Preference**: More is better (safety, show of strength)

**Value Function**:
```
escorts | Value | Marginal Change
0       | 0.00  | (unacceptable)
1       | 0.40  | +0.40
2       | 0.60  | +0.20
3       | 0.70  | +0.10 (diminishing returns)
4       | 0.75  | +0.05
5       | 0.78  | +0.03
```

**Interpretation**:
- 0 escorts: Terrible (value 0)
- 1 escort: Big jump (value 0.40)
- 2 escorts: Good increase (value 0.60)
- 3+ escorts: Diminishing returns

**Strategic Implication**:
- Getting from 0 to 1: Huge (+0.40)
- Getting from 1 to 2: Valuable (+0.20)
- Getting from 2 to 3: Nice but not critical (+0.10)
- **Prioritize**: Fight for 1 escort (critical), push for 2 if possible, don't worry about 3+

---

#### Philippines: Pre-Notification Hours

**Preference**: Shorter is better (operational flexibility, sovereignty signal)

**Value Function**:
```
hours | Value | Marginal Change
0     | 1.00  | -
6     | 0.85  | -0.15
12    | 0.70  | -0.15
18    | 0.55  | -0.15
24    | 0.40  | -0.15
36    | 0.20  | -0.20 (steeper decline)
48    | 0.00  | -0.20
```

**Interpretation**:
- Linear decline from 0-24 hours
- Steeper decline beyond 24 hours (feels like asking permission)

**Strategic Implication**:
- 8 vs 12 hours: Doesn't matter much (0.10 difference)
- 12 vs 18 hours: Still acceptable (0.15 difference)
- 24 vs 36 hours: Big problem (0.20 difference)
- **This is a good trading chip**: You can give China longer notification (12→18h) without hurting yourself much

---

#### China: Same Parameters, Different Preferences

**Standoff Distance** (Higher is better for China):
```
standoff_nm | Value (China) | Reasoning
0-2         | 0.00          | "Loses" too much, appears weak
3           | 0.30          | Minimal acceptable
4           | 0.50          | Neutral
5           | 0.70          | Good (maintains distance posture)
6-7         | 0.85          | Very good
8+          | 1.00          | Ideal (strong control signal)
```

**Why This Matters**:
- Your preference: Lower standoff
- China's preference: Higher standoff
- **Trade space**: 3-5nm (both parties somewhat satisfied)

---

#### Communication Protocols: Both Parties Benefit

**24/7 Hotline**:
```
Option  | Philippines Value | China Value | Reasoning
Ad-hoc  | 0.40              | 0.45        | Both parties worse off (slower de-escalation)
24/7    | 0.60              | 0.55        | Both parties better off (crisis management)
```

**Why This Matters**:
- **Win-win option!**
- Both parties gain from 24/7 hotline
- Easy agreement point
- Should always be included

**Strategic Use**:
- Agree early (builds momentum)
- Don't use as trading chip (you want it too)

---

#### Media Embargo: Asymmetric Preferences

**Philippines**:
```
Hours | Value | Reasoning
0     | 0.45  | Transparency good, but immediate reports escalate
6     | 0.50  | Baseline
12    | 0.48  | Slight negative (losing transparency)
24    | 0.40  | Negative (looks like hiding)
```

**China**:
```
Hours | Value | Reasoning
0     | 0.20  | Very bad (no narrative control)
6     | 0.50  | Baseline (some time)
12    | 0.65  | Good (adequate face-saving time)
24    | 0.80  | Very good (full control)
```

**Why This Matters**:
- **You don't care much** (value only drops 0.05 from 6h to 12h)
- **China cares a LOT** (value jumps 0.15 from 6h to 12h)
- **Perfect trading chip**!

**Strategy**:
- Offer 6h initially (show you value transparency)
- Trade to 12h for something important to you (standoff, escorts)
- Example: "I'll give you 12h embargo if you give me 4nm standoff instead of 5nm"

## Reading Your Metrics

### Utility Score Deep Dive

**What You See**: "Your Utility: 64%"

**What It Means**: You get 64% of the distance from your BATNA to your ideal outcome

#### Utility Scale Interpretation (For YOU Specifically)

**Example**: Philippines BATNA = 0.25

```
Utility | Interpretation | How You Should Feel
------------------------------------------------------
0.85+   | Excellent      | This is near-perfect! Accept immediately!
0.70-   | Very Good      | This is a strong offer. Definitely accept.
0.60-0.70| Good          | This is above expectations. Accept.
0.50-0.60| Acceptable    | This is solid. Probably accept.
0.40-0.50| Marginal      | This is at BATNA threshold. Consider carefully.
0.30-0.40| Poor          | This is below BATNA. Likely reject or counter.
<0.30   | Unacceptable  | This is much worse than BATNA. Reject.
```

#### Contextual Interpretation

**Utility Alone Isn't Enough - Consider Context**:

**Scenario 1**: You get utility 0.52
- **Your initial hope**: 0.70 (wanted strong agreement)
- **Your feeling**: Disappointed
- **BUT**: Your BATNA is 0.25
- **Reality**: 0.52 is actually meaningful improvement over 0.25
- **Context**: In high-tension scenario, 0.52 is realistic
- **Decision**: Should probably accept

**Scenario 2**: You get utility 0.52
- **Your BATNA**: 0.40 (your fallback isn't terrible)
- **Reality**: 0.52 is only barely better than 0.40
- **Context**: Low-tension scenario, more room for better deals
- **Decision**: Push for more (try for 0.60)

#### Comparing Your Utility Across Offers

**Offer A**:
- Standoff 4nm, Escorts 2, Notification 12h, Embargo 8h
- Your utility: 0.65

**Offer B**:
- Standoff 3nm, Escorts 1, Notification 18h, Embargo 12h
- Your utility: 0.63

**Analysis**:
- Offer A slightly better (0.65 vs 0.63)
- But almost identical
- **Consider**: Which is more likely China accepts?
- Offer B: Lower standoff (China dislikes) but longer embargo (China likes)
- Maybe Offer B more balanced even though YOUR utility slightly lower
- **Strategic choice**: Offer B might be better deal overall

**Key Insight**: Sometimes accepting slightly lower utility for yourself creates more balanced deal that's more likely to succeed

---

### Acceptance Probability

**What You See**: "Your Acceptance Probability: 72%"

**What It Means**: Statistical likelihood you'd accept this offer

#### Why Not 1-to-1 with Utility?

**Example**:
- Utility: 0.60
- Acceptance: 72%

Why 72% and not 60%?

**Answer**: Risk Attitude

**Philippines (Risk-Averse)**:
- You're in weaker position
- Current situation (BATNA) is risky/bad
- **You prefer certainty over gambling**
- So: Acceptance Probability > Utility
- **Example**: Utility 0.60 → Acceptance 72% (higher)

**China (Risk-Neutral to Risk-Seeking)**:
- They're in stronger position
- Current situation (BATNA) is tolerable
- **They can afford to hold out for better**
- So: Acceptance Probability ≈ Utility (or even lower)
- **Example**: Utility 0.60 → Acceptance 58% (lower)

#### Formula

```
Acceptance_Probability = 1 / (1 + e^(-k × (Utility - 0.5)))

Where:
- k = steepness (typically 5-10)
- Higher k = steeper curve (small utility changes = big acceptance changes)
```

**Philippines (k=8, risk-averse)**:
```
Utility | Acceptance
0.30    | 18%
0.40    | 38%
0.50    | 50%
0.60    | 72%  ← More willing to accept than utility suggests
0.70    | 86%
0.80    | 95%
```

**China (k=5, risk-neutral)**:
```
Utility | Acceptance
0.30    | 20%
0.40    | 35%
0.50    | 50%
0.60    | 65%  ← Less willing to accept than utility suggests
0.70    | 78%
0.80    | 88%
```

#### Why This Matters for Your Strategy

**If You're Philippines (Risk-Averse)**:
- Don't be too greedy
- 0.55-0.60 utility is good enough
- Pushing for 0.70 might risk losing deal
- **Accept solid offers** (don't hold out for perfect)

**If You're China (Risk-Seeking)**:
- You can push for more
- Don't settle for 0.50-0.55
- You can afford to reject and counter
- **Hold out for better terms** (you have leverage)

---

### What You Don't Know (And Why)

**You See**:
- Your utility: 0.64
- Your acceptance: 76%

**You DON'T See**:
- Other party's utility: ???
- Other party's acceptance: ???
- Overall agreement probability: ???
- ZOPA analysis: ???
- Nash product: ???

#### Why You Don't See This

**Reason 1: Realism**
- In real negotiation, you don't know exact satisfaction of other side
- You must infer from behavior, statements, body language
- This simulation teaches incomplete information negotiation

**Reason 2: Strategic**
- If you saw other party's utility, negotiation would be trivial
- "Oh, they're at 0.75? I don't need to give them anything!"
- "Oh, they're at 0.35? I need to give them a lot"
- **Realistic** uncertainty forces strategic thinking

**Reason 3: Pedagogical**
- Learning to read signals is crucial skill
- Learning to balance your needs with unknowns
- Learning to manage risk and uncertainty

#### How to Infer What You Don't Know

**Signal 1: Facilitator Comments**

**Facilitator Says**: "Philippines seems satisfied, but China has some concerns"

**What You Can Infer** (if you're Philippines):
- Your utility: Probably 0.60+ ("satisfied")
- China's utility: Probably 0.40-0.55 ("concerns" = marginal)
- **Implication**: China needs sweetening
- **Action**: Offer small concession to China

**Facilitator Says**: "Both parties are in acceptable range, but there's room for improvement"

**What You Can Infer**:
- Both utilities: Probably 0.45-0.55 (above BATNA, not great)
- **Implication**: Deal possible but not optimal
- **Action**: Try to improve without breaking deal

**Signal 2: Other Party's Behavior**

**They Counter-Offer Immediately, Changing Only 1-2 Parameters**:
- **Inference**: They're close to accepting, just need small adjustment
- **Your Action**: Probably accept their counter-offer or meet in middle

**They Counter-Offer with Major Changes to All Parameters**:
- **Inference**: They're far from their acceptable range
- **Your Action**: Significant negotiation still needed

**They Keep Pushing Back on Same Issue**:
- **Example**: China always pushes for higher standoff, doesn't care about other issues
- **Inference**: Standoff is weighted heavily in their utility
- **Your Action**: Focus negotiation on that parameter

**Signal 3: Indirect Hints**

**Facilitator**: "Think about issue X - maybe there's room there?"
- **Inference**: Issue X is where the gap is
- **Your Action**: Adjust parameters in issue X

**Facilitator**: "You're making progress"
- **Inference**: Utilities are converging
- **Your Action**: Keep negotiating in same direction

---

## Negotiation Strategy Framework

### The Negotiation Process

#### Phase 1: Preparation (Before First Offer)

**Task 1: Understand Your Position**
1. Read Tab 1 completely
2. Identify your TOP 2 priorities
3. Identify your red lines (dealbreakers)
4. Identify what you don't care about (trading chips)

**Task 2: Research**
1. If available, read about the scenario (manual, context)
2. Understand the other party's perspective (what do they want?)
3. Think about creative solutions

**Task 3: Plan Your Opening**
1. Decide your first offer
2. Should be ambitious but not ridiculous
3. Should signal your priorities
4. Example (Philippines): 3nm, 2 escorts, 12h notice, 6h embargo
   - Ambitious on what matters (standoff, escorts)
   - Reasonable on others (notice, embargo)

---

#### Phase 2: Opening Offers (Rounds 1-2)

**If You Go First**:
1. Make your planned opening offer
2. Preview your utility (should be 0.65-0.75, good for you)
3. Submit
4. Wait for feedback

**If They Go First**:
1. Review their offer in Tab 2
2. Calculate your utility
3. Analyze:
   - Is their offer good for you? (>0.60 = strong)
   - What does it tell you about their priorities?
   - What can you infer about what they care about?
4. Decide:
   - Accept (if >0.65 and seems balanced)
   - Counter-offer (most likely)

**Counter-Offering Strategy**:
- Don't just reject - propose alternative
- Move toward their position on some issues
- Hold firm on your priorities
- Signal willingness to negotiate

**Example** (Philippines):
- They offer: 6nm, 1 escort, 18h notice, 12h embargo
- Your utility: 0.42 (below BATNA!)
- **Analysis**:
  - 6nm is too far (your operations suffer)
  - 1 escort ok
  - 18h notice acceptable
  - 12h embargo fine (you don't care)
- **Counter**: 4nm, 1 escort, 18h notice, 12h embargo
  - Accept their escort, notice, embargo (3 of 4)
  - Push back hard on standoff (your priority)
  - **Signal**: You're flexible, but standoff matters

---

#### Phase 3: Negotiation (Rounds 3-5)

**Reading the Room**:
- Watch facilitator comments carefully
- Track patterns in other party's responses
- Adjust strategy based on signals

**Adjusting Your Position**:
- Each round, move slightly toward middle
- Don't make same offer twice (shows inflexibility)
- Don't move too fast (leaves value on table)

**Example Progression** (Philippines on standoff):
```
Round 1 (You): 3nm
Round 1 (China): 7nm

Round 2 (You): 4nm  ← Move from 3 to 4 (significant concession)
Round 2 (China): 6nm  ← They move from 7 to 6

Round 3 (You): 4nm  ← Hold firm (signal this is important)
Round 3 (China): 5nm  ← They move again

Round 4 (You): 4.5nm  ← Small concession (meeting in middle)
Round 4 (China): 5nm  ← They hold

Round 5 (You): 4.5nm or 5nm  ← Decision point
- Utilities at 4.5nm: You=0.63, overall probably 50-55%
- Utilities at 5nm: You=0.59, overall probably 60-65%
- **Trade-off**: Your utility vs deal probability
```

**Strategic Decision**:
- Accept 5nm? You get utility 0.59 (acceptable), high chance of agreement
- Hold at 4.5nm? You get utility 0.63 (better), lower chance (they might reject)

**Factors to Consider**:
- How much do you trust the deal at 5nm will be accepted?
- What's your BATNA? (If BATNA=0.25, then 0.59 is still much better)
- What does facilitator hint? ("You're very close" = accept 5nm)
- Time pressure? (Running out of time = accept 5nm)

---

#### Phase 4: Convergence (Rounds 6+)

**When You're Close**:
- Facilitator says "you're very close"
- Offers are similar (only 1-2 parameters differ)
- Both sides making small adjustments

**Final Push**:
- One side needs to accept or meet in middle
- Consider: Make final concession IF
  - Your utility still >0.50
  - You've gotten your must-haves
  - Facilitator signals this will close deal

**Example**:
- Current offer on table: 5nm, 1 escort, 15h notice, 10h embargo
- Your utility: 0.58
- You want: 4nm (would give you 0.62)
- **Facilitator**: "Both parties very close, just need final adjustment"
- **Decision**: Accept 5nm
  - Utility 0.58 is good (well above BATNA 0.25)
  - You got 1 escort (must-have)
  - 5nm is acceptable (red line was >6nm)
  - Pushing for 4nm risks losing deal

---

### Advanced Negotiation Tactics

#### Tactic 1: Package Deals

**Concept**: Trade across multiple issues simultaneously

**Example** (Philippines):
- You want: Standoff 4nm (high priority)
- They want: Embargo 12h (high priority for them, low for you)
- **Package**: "I'll accept 12h embargo if you accept 4nm standoff"

**Why This Works**:
- Efficient trade (both sides gain)
- Signals sophistication
- Moves negotiation forward quickly

**How to Find Package Deals**:
1. Identify what you care about (standoff)
2. Identify what you don't care about (embargo)
3. Infer what they care about (they keep pushing for longer embargo)
4. **Trade**: Give them what they want (embargo) for what you want (standoff)

---

#### Tactic 2: Conditional Agreements

**Concept**: Vary terms based on conditions

**Example 1**: Weather-Dependent Escorts
- "1 escort in calm weather, 2 escorts in rough seas"
- **Why**: Balances security (Philippines) with de-militarization (China)

**Example 2**: Time-Dependent Notification
- "12 hours standard, 6 hours for emergency resupply"
- **Why**: Flexibility (Philippines) with predictability (China)

**Example 3**: Incident-Dependent Embargo
- "6 hour embargo for minor incidents, 12 hours for serious incidents"
- **Why**: Transparency (Philippines) with face-saving for serious incidents (China)

**How to Propose**:
- Frame as creative solution (not deception)
- Show how it benefits both parties
- **Example**: "What if we have different escort counts based on weather? That way we maintain safety in rough seas, but reduce presence in calm weather."

---

#### Tactic 3: Signal Your Constraints

**Concept**: Help other party understand your limitations

**Example** (Philippines):
- "I understand you want higher standoff, but operationally we cannot resupply safely beyond 5nm. Below 5nm, I'm flexible on exact distance."

**Why This Works**:
- Helps them understand your red lines
- Builds trust (transparency)
- Focuses negotiation on feasible zone

**When to Use**:
- When stuck on same issue repeatedly
- When you hit a genuine constraint
- NOT when it's just preference (save for real red lines)

---

#### Tactic 4: Anchor on Your Interests, Not Positions

**Position** (less effective): "I need 2 escorts"
**Interest** (more effective): "I need to ensure personnel safety during resupply"

**Why Interests Matter**:
- Opens multiple solutions
- Positions: Only one solution (2 escorts)
- Interests: Multiple solutions (2 escorts OR better CUES OR shorter standoff OR 24/7 hotline)

**Example Conversation**:

**You (Position)**: "I need 2 escorts"
**China**: "No, 2 is too militarized"
**Stuck!**

vs.

**You (Interest)**: "I need to ensure personnel safety during resupply"
**China**: "We also want safety. What if we had 1 escort but stricter CUES requirements?"
**You**: "That could work - 1 escort plus safe distance keeping and AIS?"
**China**: "Acceptable"
**Agreement!**

---

#### Tactic 5: Make Them Feel They Won

**Concept**: Frame concessions as their victory, not your loss

**Example** (Philippines):
- **Don't say**: "Fine, I'll accept 5nm even though I wanted 4nm"
- **Do say**: "5nm seems reasonable given your security concerns. I appreciate your flexibility on the 24/7 hotline."

**Why This Works**:
- China cares about face
- Framing matters as much as substance
- Helps them accept deal domestically

**Implementation**:
- When you make concession, acknowledge their point
- When they make concession, appreciate it
- Frame agreement as mutual victory, not compromise

---

## Strategic Considerations by Scenario

### Scenario A: Second Thomas Shoal

**Your Role**: Philippines

#### Scenario-Specific Context

**What Makes This Hard**:
- Very high tension
- Repeated incidents
- Strong domestic pressure (both sides)
- High media visibility

**What Helps**:
- Clear operational focus (resupply)
- International law on your side
- Tribunal ruling

#### Your Priorities (Philippines)

**Must-Have**:
1. Standoff ≤5nm (operational necessity)
2. ≥1 escort (safety + domestic face)
3. Pre-notification, NOT pre-approval (sovereignty)
4. 24/7 hotline (safety)

**Nice-to-Have**:
5. Standoff ≤4nm (easier ops)
6. 2 escorts (better protection)
7. AIS transparency (verification)

**Trading Chips**:
- Media embargo (don't care much)
- Exact notification time (12-18h all fine)
- Video recording (nice but not critical)

#### Recommended Opening (Philippines)

```json
{
  "resupply_SOP": {
    "standoff_nm": 3,
    "escort_count": 2,
    "pre_notification_hours": 12
  },
  "hotline_cues": {
    "hotline_status": "24_7",
    "cues_checklist": ["distance", "AIS_on", "video_record"]
  },
  "media_protocol": {
    "embargo_hours": 6
  }
}
```

**Reasoning**:
- **Standoff 3nm**: Ambitious but defensible (operational optimum)
- **2 escorts**: Shows strength, room to negotiate down to 1
- **12h notification**: Balanced, not asking for too little
- **24/7 hotline + full CUES**: Safety is priority, signal professionalism
- **6h embargo**: Show you value transparency, but room to trade

**Expected Your Utility**: 0.72-0.78 (very good for you, intentionally high for opening)

---

#### Negotiation Path (Philippines)

**Round 1-2: Establishing Positions**

China will likely counter with:
- Standoff 7-8nm (high)
- 0-1 escort (low)
- 18-24h notification (long)
- 12-24h embargo (long)

**Your Response**:
- Don't panic at big gap (normal)
- Identify where you can move: Embargo, notification
- Identify where you can't: Standoff, escorts (not much)

**Round 3-4: Finding Middle Ground**

Adjust your offer:
```json
{
  "standoff_nm": 4,        ← Moved from 3 (significant concession)
  "escort_count": 1,       ← Moved from 2 (show flexibility)
  "pre_notification_hours": 15,  ← Moved from 12 (minor concession)
  "hotline_status": "24_7",
  "cues_checklist": ["distance", "AIS_on"],  ← Dropped video (trade)
  "embargo_hours": 10      ← Moved from 6 (trading chip)
}
```

**Signals**:
- You made major move on escorts (2→1)
- You moved on standoff (3→4)
- You gave on embargo (6→10)
- You're keeping 24/7 hotline (mutual interest)

**Expected Utility**: 0.60-0.65 (still good)

**Round 5-6: Convergence**

If China comes back with standoff 5-6nm, you're facing decision:

**Option A: Accept 5nm**
- Utility: ~0.58
- Still operational (though harder)
- Above your BATNA (0.25)
- Gets you agreement

**Option B: Hold at 4nm**
- Utility: ~0.65
- Better for operations
- Risk: China might reject
- Depends on facilitator signals

**Decision Framework**:
- If facilitator says "very close": Accept 5nm
- If facilitator says "still gap": Try for 4.5nm
- If time running out: Accept 5nm
- If early in process: Hold at 4nm

---

#### Expected Outcome Range (Philippines)

**Realistic Final Agreement**:
```json
{
  "standoff_nm": 4-5,
  "escort_count": 1,
  "pre_notification_hours": 12-18,
  "hotline_status": "24_7",
  "cues_checklist": ["distance", "AIS_on"],
  "embargo_hours": 8-12
}
```

**Your Expected Utility**: 0.55-0.65
- **0.65**: Excellent outcome (standoff 4nm, got most of what you wanted)
- **0.60**: Good outcome (standoff 4.5nm, balanced deal)
- **0.55**: Acceptable outcome (standoff 5nm, but workable)

**Below 0.50**: Consider rejecting or major renegotiation

---

#### Common Mistakes (Philippines - Scenario A)

**Mistake 1: Holding Out for Perfect**
- **What**: Rejecting offer with utility 0.60 because you want 0.70
- **Why Bad**: 0.60 is already significantly better than BATNA (0.25)
- **Result**: Negotiation fails, you're stuck with terrible BATNA
- **Fix**: Remember your BATNA is bad; accept solid offers

**Mistake 2: Giving Up Sovereignty Signal**
- **What**: Accepting "pre-approval" language to get better terms
- **Why Bad**: Violates core constraint (sovereignty)
- **Result**: Domestic political crisis, agreement unsustainable
- **Fix**: Hold firm on notification vs approval distinction

**Mistake 3: Over-Focusing on Escorts**
- **What**: Fighting hard for 2 escorts when 1 is acceptable
- **Why Bad**: Escorts are visible militarization (China very sensitive)
- **Result**: Deal breaks over escort count
- **Fix**: Accept 1 escort, get better CUES/hotline for safety

**Mistake 4: Ignoring Operational Reality**
- **What**: Accepting 7-8nm standoff to close deal
- **Why Bad**: Can't actually resupply at that distance
- **Result**: Agreement that doesn't work in practice
- **Fix**: Hold firm on operational feasibility (<6nm)

---

### Scenario A: Opponent Perspective (China)

**Note**: If you're playing China in this scenario, your priorities are different.

#### Your Priorities (China)

**Must-Have**:
1. Maintain sovereignty narrative (don't appear to "lose")
2. Some form of control signal (pre-notification minimum)
3. Avoid appearance of militarization (limit escorts)

**Nice-to-Have**:
4. Higher standoff (5-7nm shows distance/control)
5. Longer notification (18-24h shows Chinese control)
6. Media embargo (narrative control)

**Trading Chips**:
- Exact standoff (as long as >4nm)
- Hotline setup (24/7 actually benefits you too)
- CUES details (safety is mutual interest)

---

#### Recommended Opening (China)

```json
{
  "standoff_nm": 8,
  "escort_count": 0,
  "pre_notification_hours": 24,
  "hotline_status": "ad_hoc",
  "cues_checklist": ["distance"],
  "embargo_hours": 24
}
```

**Reasoning**:
- **High standoff**: Start high, room to come down
- **0 escorts**: Extreme position, expect to compromise to 1
- **24h notification**: Show control, can accept less
- **Ad-hoc hotline**: Room to give 24/7 (actually good for you)
- **Minimal CUES**: Start restrictive, can add distance keeping
- **Long embargo**: Very important to you (face/narrative)

**Expected Your Utility**: 0.75-0.80 (very good for you)

---

#### Negotiation Path (China)

**Your Strategy**:
- Give on things that don't hurt you (hotline, some CUES)
- Hold on things that signal control (notification, standoff)
- Fight hard on optics (escorts, embargo)

**Round 3-4 Adjustment**:
```json
{
  "standoff_nm": 6,          ← Moved from 8 (significant)
  "escort_count": 1,         ← Moved from 0 (accepting reality)
  "pre_notification_hours": 18,  ← Moved from 24 (compromise)
  "hotline_status": "24_7",  ← Gave this (win-win)
  "cues_checklist": ["distance", "AIS_on"],  ← Gave some transparency
  "embargo_hours": 18        ← Hold firm (important to you)
}
```

**Signals**:
- You made major move on standoff (8→6)
- You accepted 1 escort (pragmatic)
- You gave 24/7 hotline (responsible image)
- You're holding on embargo (face is priority)

**Expected Utility**: 0.55-0.60 (acceptable)

---

#### Expected Outcome Range (China)

**Realistic Final Agreement**: Same as Philippines perspective (it's the same agreement!)

**Your Expected Utility**: 0.50-0.60
- **0.60**: Good outcome (standoff 5-6nm, longer embargo)
- **0.55**: Acceptable outcome (standoff 5nm, moderate embargo)
- **0.50**: Marginal outcome (standoff 4nm, shorter embargo)

**Below 0.45**: Consider rejecting

---

### Scenario B: Scarborough Shoal

**Context**: Disputed fishing grounds, China seized in 2012, now controlling access

**Parties**: Philippines (fishing access) vs China (sovereignty assertion)

#### Key Differences from Scenario A

**Different Stakes**:
- Scenario A: Military garrison resupply
- Scenario B: Civilian fishing access
- **Implication**: More room for pragmatic solutions

**Different Dynamics**:
- Less military posturing (no garrison)
- More economic focus (fishing livelihoods)
- More regional attention (other ASEAN fishermen affected)

---

#### Your Priorities (Philippines - Scenario B)

**Must-Have**:
1. Filipino fishing access (economic necessity)
2. No "permission" requirement (sovereignty)
3. Safety for fishermen (no harassment)

**Nice-to-Have**:
4. Broad access area
5. Long fishing seasons
6. Minimal restrictions

**Trading Chips**:
- Willing to notify (transparency builds trust)
- Can accept some quotas (conservation framing)
- Can accept joint patrol (if truly joint)

---

#### Recommended Approach (Philippines - Scenario B)

**Opening Position**:
- Unrestricted fishing access (starting point)
- Notification of large fleet movements (reasonable)
- Joint coast guard patrols (shared responsibility)
- No quotas initially (will trade later)

**Negotiation Path**:
- Frame as "traditional fishing grounds" (historical right)
- Emphasize livelihoods (humanitarian)
- Offer conservation measures (quota) for access
- Suggest joint management (face-saving for China)

**Expected Compromise**:
- Fishing access with notification (12-24h for fleets)
- Modest quota (sustainable harvest)
- Joint patrols (both flags present)
- Shared VMS monitoring (transparency)

**Your Expected Utility**: 0.60-0.70 (less tense than Scenario A)

---

#### Your Priorities (China - Scenario B)

**Must-Have**:
1. Maintain sovereignty posture (control narrative)
2. Some control mechanism (quotas or notification)
3. Avoid precedent of "free access" (other claimants watching)

**Nice-to-Have**:
4. Philippines acknowledge Chinese administration (unlikely)
5. Quotas favor Chinese fishermen
6. Joint patrols China-led

**Trading Chips**:
- Total prohibition not necessary (willing to allow access)
- Exact quota levels (flexible)
- Can frame as "humanitarian consideration" (face-saving)

**Expected Compromise**: Same as Philippines (it's the same deal)

**Your Expected Utility**: 0.55-0.65 (pragmatic solution possible)

---

### Scenario C: Kasawari Gas Field (Malaysia-China)

**Context**: Gas exploration in Malaysia's EEZ, China's nine-dash line overlaps

**Parties**: Malaysia (resource development) vs China (sovereignty claim)

#### Key Differences

**Different Legal Position**:
- Malaysia: Very strong UNCLOS EEZ claim (not claiming islands)
- China: Historical rights claim (weaker legally)
- **Implication**: Malaysia has strong legal leverage

**Different Relationship**:
- Better Malaysia-China relations historically
- Malaysia more neutral, less confrontational
- More room for economic solutions

---

#### Your Priorities (Malaysia - Scenario C)

**Must-Have**:
1. Right to develop resources in own EEZ (principle)
2. Economic returns from gas field (development)
3. No prejudice to EEZ rights (don't set bad precedent)

**Nice-to-Have**:
4. Sole development (don't want to share revenue)
5. No Chinese presence in operations
6. International partners welcome (US/EU companies)

**Trading Chips**:
- Can offer joint development (revenue sharing)
- Can accept Chinese participation (if economically fair)
- Can agree to delayed sovereignty discussion (pragmatism)

---

#### Recommended Approach (Malaysia - Scenario C)

**Opening Position**:
- Sole Malaysian development (starting point)
- International partners involved (diversification)
- Revenue 100% Malaysia (it's our EEZ)
- Willing to sell gas to China (market terms)

**Negotiation Path**:
- Emphasize EEZ law (strong legal case)
- Avoid sovereignty claims on islands (stay in strong position)
- Offer joint development if necessary (win-win framing)
- Propose revenue split (60/40 or 70/30 in Malaysia's favor)

**Creative Solutions**:
- Joint venture with Chinese company (commercial not sovereign)
- Revenue sharing but Malaysia-led operations
- Supply agreement (China gets gas, Malaysia keeps control)
- Technology partnership (Chinese equipment for stake)

**Expected Compromise**:
- Joint development structure (Malaysian-led)
- Revenue split (60-70% Malaysia, 30-40% China)
- Sovereignty issue set aside ("without prejudice" clause)
- Commercial framework, not political

**Your Expected Utility**: 0.65-0.75 (good outcome possible)

---

#### Your Priorities (China - Scenario C)

**Must-Have**:
1. Participation in development (shows nine-dash line isn't empty)
2. Revenue share (economic benefit)
3. Avoid establishing EEZ precedent (other areas affected)

**Nice-to-Have**:
4. Equal or majority share
5. Chinese companies lead operations
6. Malaysia acknowledge Chinese claim (unlikely)

**Trading Chips**:
- Can accept minority stake (better than nothing)
- Can accept Malaysia-led operations (as long as participating)
- Can frame as "joint development without prejudice to sovereignty"

**Expected Utility**: 0.55-0.70 (pragmatic deal possible, both sides win economically)

---

### Scenario D: Natuna Islands (Indonesia-China)

**Context**: Indonesian EEZ around Natuna, China's nine-dash line crosses it, fishing disputes

**Parties**: Indonesia (not claimant but defending EEZ) vs China

#### Key Differences

**Indonesia's Unique Position**:
- Not claimant in main SCS disputes
- Only defending EEZ, not claiming islands
- Very strong legal position (UNCLOS EEZ clear-cut)
- More willing to escalate (less China-dependent than others)

**Different Dynamics**:
- Primarily fishing rights issue
- Indonesia more assertive (sinks illegal fishing vessels)
- China wants good relationship (regional leader)

---

#### Your Priorities (Indonesia - Scenario D)

**Must-Have**:
1. Exclusive EEZ rights (non-negotiable under UNCLOS)
2. No Chinese fishing in Indonesian EEZ without permission
3. Enforcement authority (can arrest illegal fishermen)

**Nice-to-Have**:
4. Chinese acknowledgment of EEZ
5. Cooperation on illegal fishing from other nations
6. Economic partnership (development)

**Trading Chips**:
- Can offer legal access with proper permits
- Can cooperate on other illegal fishing (3rd countries)
- Can separate EEZ issue from SCS disputes (stay neutral)

---

#### Recommended Approach (Indonesia - Scenario D)

**Opening Position**:
- Full EEZ rights enforcement (law-based)
- Chinese vessels must have Indonesian permits
- Will continue sinking illegal vessels (deterrence)
- Willing to issue permits under Indonesian law

**Negotiation Path**:
- Emphasize this is EEZ not territorial dispute (different issue)
- Offer legal fishing access (permits, quotas, fees)
- Frame as mutual interest in sustainability
- Separate from other SCS issues (Indonesia neutral there)

**Expected Compromise**:
- Chinese fishing allowed with Indonesian permits
- Quota system (sustainable harvest)
- Fees paid to Indonesia (sovereignty signal)
- Joint enforcement of illegal fishing from 3rd countries
- China tacitly accepts Indonesian EEZ (doesn't say so publicly)

**Your Expected Utility**: 0.70-0.80 (strong legal position, balanced relationship)

---

#### Your Priorities (China - Scenario D)

**Must-Have**:
1. Access for Chinese fishermen (economic/political)
2. Don't explicitly abandon nine-dash line (domestic constraint)
3. Maintain regional relationship with Indonesia

**Nice-to-Have**:
4. No fees (would imply accepting Indonesian sovereignty)
5. More generous quotas
6. Indonesia stays neutral in other SCS disputes

**Trading Chips**:
- Can accept permit system if not called "Indonesian permission"
- Can accept quotas (conservation framing)
- Can pay fees if framed as "conservation contribution" not sovereignty

**Expected Compromise**: Same as Indonesia perspective

**Your Expected Utility**: 0.50-0.65 (accepting reality of EEZ law while maintaining face)

---

## Advanced Tactics

### Creating Value Through Linkage

**Concept**: Connect this negotiation to other issues to expand trade space

#### Tactic: Link to Broader Relationship

**Example** (Malaysia-China on gas field):
- **Isolated**: Just negotiating revenue split on one field
- **Linked**: "We agree to 60/40 split here, and separately, Malaysia will support China's RCEP proposal"

**Why This Works**:
- Expands what's on the table
- Both sides can gain more
- Helps justify concessions domestically

**When to Use**:
- When stuck on zero-sum issue
- When you have broader relationship
- When both sides need win narratives

**Caution**:
- Don't over-link (can make complex negotiations impossible)
- Ensure linkages are genuine (not extortion)
- Document clearly what's linked and what's separate

---

### Sequencing Concessions Strategically

**Concept**: Order of concessions affects perception and reciprocity

#### Tactic: Give Small → Receive Big → Give Big

**Example** (Philippines):

**Round 1**: You give small (embargo 6h → 8h)
- Small cost to you
- China appreciates gesture
- Builds goodwill

**Round 2**: You ask for big (standoff 5nm → 4nm)
- Now you're "owed" for your concession
- Reciprocity norm activated
- More likely to get it

**Round 3**: You give big (escorts 2 → 1)
- Shows seriousness
- Moves toward final agreement
- But you already got your standoff reduction

**Why This Works**:
- Psychological reciprocity
- Building momentum
- Strategic timing of major concessions

**Contrast with Bad Sequencing**:
- Give big first (escorts 2 → 1)
- Ask for big (standoff 5nm → 4nm)
- Give small (embargo 6h → 8h)
- **Problem**: You "spent" your big concession early, China less motivated to reciprocate later

---

### Using Time Pressure Strategically

**Concept**: Time pressure affects both parties differently

#### If You're Desperate (Philippines in Scenario A)

**Your Situation**:
- BATNA is bad (current situation unsustainable)
- Need agreement more than China does
- Time pressure hurts you

**Strategy**:
- **DON'T**: Rush to accept bad deals
- **DO**: Create internal deadlines ("I need to report progress to president")
- **DO**: Show willingness to walk away if necessary (even if bluffing)
- **DO**: Focus on objective criteria ("UNCLOS says...", "historical data shows...")

**Why**: Reduces appearance of desperation, maintains leverage

---

#### If You're Patient (China in Scenario A)

**Your Situation**:
- BATNA is acceptable (status quo tolerable)
- Don't need agreement urgently
- Time pressure helps you

**Strategy**:
- **DO**: Take your time, don't rush
- **DO**: Ask for breaks to "consult Beijing"
- **DO**: Incrementally concede (slowly move toward middle)
- **DON'T**: Abuse your advantage (can backfire, make deal impossible)

**Why**: Leverage your stronger position, but don't overplay it

---

#### Creating Positive Time Pressure

**Tactic**: Introduce deadline that helps both parties

**Example**: "Regional forum meeting in 2 weeks - both our presidents will be there. Would be great to announce agreement by then."

**Why This Works**:
- Mutual deadline (not one-sided)
- Positive framing (opportunity, not threat)
- Creates momentum toward agreement

**How to Use**:
- Introduce early in negotiation
- Make it credible (real event)
- Frame as opportunity for both parties

---

### Cultural Intelligence in SCS Negotiations

**Concept**: Cultural factors affect negotiation styles and preferences

#### Understanding "Face" (Chinese Context)

**What It Means**:
- Public reputation and respect
- Avoiding humiliation or appearance of weakness
- Maintaining dignity

**Implications for Negotiation**:
1. **Public vs Private**: China may accept privately what they can't accept publicly
2. **Framing Matters**: How deal is presented as important as substance
3. **Sequential Not Simultaneous**: Don't ask for Chinese concession right after they made one (loss of face)

**Tactical Applications**:

**Example 1**: Media Embargo
- **Why China cares**: Time to frame narrative before public knows
- **Your tactic**: Give longer embargo (China controls domestic narrative)
- **Result**: China feels respected, more flexible on substance

**Example 2**: Concession Language
- **Bad**: "China backed down on standoff distance"
- **Good**: "China magnanimously agreed to accommodate Philippine operational needs"
- **Your tactic**: Help China frame concessions as generosity, not defeat

---

#### Understanding "Sovereignty" (Southeast Asian Context)

**What It Means**:
- Post-colonial sensitivity about independence
- Cannot appear to accept foreign control
- Domestic audience watching

**Implications for Negotiation**:
1. **Notification vs Approval**: Huge difference (sovereignty signal)
2. **Unilateral vs Mutual**: Prefer mutual obligations (equality)
3. **Legal Frame**: UNCLOS/international law important (legitimacy)

**Tactical Applications**:

**Example 1**: Pre-Notification
- **Bad terminology**: "Ask permission", "seek approval", "request authorization"
- **Good terminology**: "Provide notification", "inform in advance", "coordinate"
- **Your tactic**: Use language that respects sovereignty

**Example 2**: Enforcement
- **Bad framing**: "China grants access"
- **Good framing**: "Parties coordinate access"
- **Your tactic**: Equal framing, even when power is unequal

---

### Building Trust Incrementally

**Concept**: Start with easy agreements, build toward harder ones

#### Tactic: "Nothing is Agreed Until Everything is Agreed" BUT Build Progressively

**Phase 1: Easy Wins**
- Agree on 24/7 hotline (win-win)
- Agree on basic CUES (safety is mutual)
- Establish communication protocol

**Why**:
- Builds momentum
- Creates positive atmosphere
- Shows both sides can agree

**Phase 2: Medium Issues**
- Tackle notification period
- Discuss media embargo
- Configure secondary parameters

**Why**:
- Confidence built from Phase 1
- Practice compromise
- Narrow remaining gaps

**Phase 3: Hard Issues**
- Finally address standoff distance
- Negotiate escort count
- Finalize difficult parameters

**Why**:
- Relationship established
- Pattern of agreement created
- Harder to walk away after progress

**Example Dialogue**:

**Facilitator**: "Let's start with communication protocols. Can we agree on 24/7 hotline?"
**Philippines**: "Yes, we want this for safety."
**China**: "Acceptable, shows professionalism."
**Facilitator**: "Excellent! First agreement. Now let's look at CUES requirements..."

[Build momentum through easy agreements]

**Facilitator**: "We've made good progress. Ready to tackle standoff distance?"
**Both parties**: [More willing because of momentum and relationship built]

---

### Dealing with Impasse

**Concept**: What to do when negotiation stalls

#### Recognizing Impasse

**Signs**:
- Same offers repeated multiple rounds
- Increasing frustration
- Facilit says "we're stuck"
- Utilities not improving

**Example**:
- Round 5: Philippines offers standoff 4nm
- Round 6: China offers standoff 6nm
- Round 7: Philippines offers standoff 4nm again
- Round 8: China offers standoff 6nm again
- **Impasse**: Neither side moving

---

#### Breaking Impasse: Tactic 1 - Change the Frame

**Current Frame** (positional):
- Philippines: "I need 4nm"
- China: "I need 6nm"
- **Stuck**: Arguing positions

**Reframe** (interests):
- Philippines: "I need safe, operationally feasible resupply"
- China: "I need to show we maintain responsible control"
- **Explore**: How else can we meet these interests?

**New Solutions**:
- What if: 5nm standoff BUT Philippines gets 2 escorts? (Philippines safety through escorts)
- What if: 5nm standoff BUT stronger CUES requirements? (Safety through procedures)
- What if: Variable standoff (4nm calm weather, 6nm rough seas)? (Context-dependent)

---

#### Breaking Impasse: Tactic 2 - Bring in Third Elements

**Current Stalemate**: Can't agree on standoff

**Introduce New Element**:
- "What if we agreed on standoff if we could settle notification period?"
- **Effect**: Expands negotiation space, new trade possible

**Example**:
- Philippines: "I'll accept 5nm standoff if you accept 8h notification"
- China: "I'll accept 8h notification if you accept 12h embargo"
- Philippines: "I'll accept 12h embargo if we're at 5nm standoff"
- **Result**: Package deal, all issues move together

---

#### Breaking Impasse: Tactic 3 - Take a Break

**When to Use**:
- High frustration
- Positions hardened
- Emotions elevated

**How**:
- "Let's take 10 minutes, review our positions"
- Use break to:
  - Calm down
  - Review strategy notes
  - Think of creative solutions
  - Consult facilitator privately

**After Break**:
- Come back with fresh perspective
- Possibly new proposal
- More willing to compromise

---

#### Breaking Impasse: Tactic 4 - Accept Mediated Compromise

**When Facilitator Says**: "I have a proposal that might work for both sides"

**Your Approach**:
- Listen carefully
- Calculate your utility
- If reasonable (utility >0.50), seriously consider accepting
- **Don't**: Automatically reject because it's not perfect

**Why This Works**:
- Facilitator sees both utilities (you don't)
- Facilitator knows where compromise space is
- Both sides more likely to accept "neutral" proposal

**Example**:
- **Facilitator**: "What about 5nm standoff, 1 escort, 12h notification, 10h embargo?"
- **Your Utility**: 0.58 (acceptable)
- **Decision**: Accept (facilitator signals this closes deal)

---

## Common Situations

### Situation 1: "The Other Party's First Offer is Insulting"

**What Happened**:
- You're Philippines
- China's first offer: 10nm standoff, 0 escorts, 48h notification
- Your utility: 0.15 (way below your BATNA of 0.25!)
- You're offended

**DON'T**:
- ❌ Get angry or quit
- ❌ Make equally extreme counter-offer in retaliation
- ❌ Take it personally

**DO**:
- ✅ Recognize this is opening position (they expect to compromise)
- ✅ Stay calm and professional
- ✅ Make reasonable counter-offer
- ✅ Signal your priorities clearly

**Response**:
"I understand this is your opening position. Let me share my priorities: operational feasibility requires standoff under 6nm, and safety requires at least 1 escort. Here's my counter-proposal..."

**Why This Works**:
- Professional tone maintained
- Signals your red lines clearly
- Moves negotiation forward
- Don't waste time being offended (it's just tactics)

---

### Situation 2: "The Facilitator Hints I Should Accept, But I Want More"

**What Happened**:
- Current offer on table: Utility 0.62 for you
- Facilitator says: "This is a good offer, both parties should seriously consider it"
- You think: "But I want utility 0.70!"

**Consider**:
- What's your BATNA? (If 0.25, then 0.62 is huge improvement)
- How many rounds have passed? (If many, deal might collapse if you push more)
- What are facilitator signals? ("Seriously consider" = strong hint to accept)

**Decision Framework**:

**Accept if**:
- ✅ Utility >0.60
- ✅ You got your must-haves
- ✅ Multiple rounds of negotiation already
- ✅ Facilitator signals this is final

**Push for more if**:
- ⚠️ Utility 0.50-0.60 (marginal)
- ⚠️ You didn't get a must-have
- ⚠️ Early in negotiation (more time)
- ⚠️ Facilitator signals room exists

**Example Decision**:
- Utility 0.62
- BATNA 0.25
- Round 7 of negotiation
- Got: 5nm standoff (acceptable), 1 escort (must-have), 24/7 hotline (wanted)
- **Decision**: Accept
- **Why**: Huge improvement over BATNA, got must-haves, prolonged negotiation risks collapse

---

### Situation 3: "I Made a Mistake in My Last Offer"

**What Happened**:
- You offered: 3nm standoff, 1 escort, 6h notification
- You realize: 6h notification is too short (you miscalculated)
- You want to change it to 12h

**CAN YOU**:
- ⚠️ Technically you can submit new offer
- ⚠️ But looks bad (inconsistent)

**BEST APPROACH**:

**Option A: Own It**
- "I need to revise my previous offer. Upon reflection, 6h notification is too aggressive. Here's updated proposal..."
- **Pro**: Honest and professional
- **Con**: Looks slightly uncertain

**Option B: Frame as Response**
- Wait for their counter-offer
- In your response, include 12h notification
- **Pro**: Looks like strategic adjustment
- **Con**: Delays correction

**RECOMMENDED**: Option A if mistake is major, Option B if minor

**WHY**: Better to correct mistakes than stick with bad offer

---

### Situation 4: "We're Running Out of Time"

**What Happened**:
- Training session ending in 15 minutes
- Still haven't reached agreement
- Facilitator: "We need to converge soon"

**Time Pressure Strategy**:

**Quick Assessment**:
1. What's current offer?
2. What's your utility?
3. Is it above BATNA?

**If YES (Above BATNA)**:
- **Action**: Accept or make final small concession
- **Why**: Agreement better than no agreement

**If NO (Below BATNA)**:
- **Action**: Make final reasonable offer, but be prepared to walk away
- **Why**: Bad deal worse than no deal

**Example**:
- Current offer: Utility 0.52
- Your BATNA: 0.25
- Time: 10 minutes left
- **Decision**: Accept (0.52 much better than 0.25, time pressure real)

---

### Situation 5: "The Other Party Keeps Changing What They Want"

**What Happened**:
- Round 1: China prioritizes standoff distance
- Round 3: China prioritizes escorts
- Round 5: China prioritizes notification
- You're confused about what they really want

**WHY THIS HAPPENS**:
- They're also learning (discovering their priorities through negotiation)
- They're testing different approaches
- Their strategy is evolving

**HOW TO RESPOND**:

**Track Patterns**:
- Note what they keep coming back to
- That's their real priority

**Ask Directly** (through facilitator):
- "Can the facilitator help us understand China's core priorities?"
- Facilitator may clarify

**Probe with Offers**:
- Make offer strong on Issue X, weak on Issue Y
- See how they respond
- If they accept weak on Y, Y isn't their priority

**Stay Flexible**:
- Don't anchor on "I thought they wanted X!"
- Adapt to what they actually want
- Use their shifting priorities to your advantage

---

### Situation 6: "I Don't Understand Why My Utility is What It Is"

**What Happened**:
- You submitted offer you thought was great
- Your utility: 0.45 (disappointing!)
- You expected: 0.65+

**DIAGNOSE**:

**Check Your Priorities**:
- What parameters did you set?
- Which parameters are high weight for YOU?
- Did you optimize for YOUR interests?

**Example** (Philippines):
- You offered: 8nm standoff, 2 escorts, 8h notification
- You thought: "2 escorts is great!"
- **Problem**: Standoff 8nm is terrible for you (operations infeasible)
- Weight: Standoff is 50% of resupply utility, escorts only 30%
- **Result**: 2 escorts don't compensate for 8nm standoff

**FIX**:
- Review parameter value functions (earlier in manual)
- Focus on high-weight parameters
- Don't over-value low-weight parameters

**LESSON**: Focus on what matters most (weights), not what you like

---

## Troubleshooting & FAQs

### Technical Issues

**Q: I can't see the current proposal in Tab 2**

**A**:
- Check: Has any offer been submitted yet?
- If not: No proposal to see (expected)
- If yes: Refresh page or check with facilitator
- Note: You only see proposals after they're submitted

---

**Q: My utility calculation is taking a long time**

**A**:
- Normal: Can take 5-10 seconds
- API processing your request
- If >30 seconds: Refresh and try again
- Check: Is API server running? (Facilitator should verify)

---

**Q: I clicked "Submit Offer" but nothing happened**

**A**:
- Check: Did you see success message?
- If no: Click again (may have missed)
- If yes: Offer submitted successfully
- Note: You can't edit after submit, only new offer

---

### Strategic Questions

**Q: How do I know if my offer is balanced?**

**A**:
You don't see other party's utility, but:
- **Your utility >0.70**: Probably too good for you (they'll reject)
- **Your utility 0.60-0.70**: Good for you, possibly balanced
- **Your utility 0.50-0.60**: Moderate for you, likely balanced
- **Your utility <0.50**: Below your BATNA, question if worth it

**Rule of Thumb**: If your utility is 0.60-0.65, and you gave on some issues, probably balanced

---

**Q: Should I always start with an extreme offer?**

**A**:
**Pros of Extreme Opening**:
- Anchors high
- Room to concede
- Signals ambition

**Cons of Extreme Opening**:
- Can offend
- Wastes time
- Damages trust

**RECOMMENDATION**:
- Start ambitious but defensible
- Not crazy extreme
- **Example** (Philippines): 3nm standoff is ambitious but operationally defensible
- **Not**: 0nm standoff (unreasonable)

---

**Q: When should I walk away from negotiation?**

**A**:
**Walk Away If**:
- All realistic offers below your BATNA
- Other party unreasonable/negotiating in bad faith
- Your constraints violated (sovereignty, principles)

**Don't Walk Away If**:
- Frustrated but offers are above BATNA
- Slow progress (patience matters)
- You didn't get ideal outcome (good enough is ok)

**Remember**: BATNA is your threshold, not "what I hoped for"

---

**Q: How many rounds is normal?**

**A**:
- **Simple scenario**: 4-6 rounds
- **Complex scenario**: 8-12 rounds
- **If stuck**: Take break, reframe, try different approach

**Concern if**:
- <3 rounds and agreement: Probably one-sided (someone settled too fast)
- >15 rounds: Probably stuck (need mediator intervention)

---

**Q: Should I share my utility with the other party?**

**A**:
**Generally NO**:
- Gives away information advantage
- They can exploit your position
- Reduces your negotiating flexibility

**Exception**:
- If both parties agree to share (transparency builds trust)
- If facilitator suggests it (trying to break impasse)
- If showing "I'm at my limit" (risk: they don't believe you)

**USUALLY**: Keep your utility to yourself

---

**Q: What if I genuinely don't care about an issue?**

**A**:
**Great! Use it!**

**Example** (Philippines on media embargo):
- You don't care if embargo is 6h or 12h
- China cares a LOT

**Strategy**:
1. Start low (6h) - signals you value transparency
2. When China pushes, offer to trade
3. "I'll give you 12h embargo if you give me 4nm standoff"
4. **Result**: You gave up something cheap (to you) for something valuable (to you)

**LESSON**: Issues you don't care about are your most valuable trading chips

---

**Q: Should I use the Preview button before submitting?**

**A**:
**YES, ALWAYS** (especially first offer)

**Why**:
- Catch mistakes (did I configure what I meant?)
- Check utility (is this good for ME?)
- Verify logic (does this make sense?)

**Workflow**:
1. Configure offer
2. Click Preview
3. Review utility
4. Adjust if needed
5. Preview again
6. Submit when satisfied

**ONLY Submit Without Preview**: If experienced and confident

---

**Q: The other party accepted my first offer. Did I offer too much?**

**A**:
**Probably YES**

**Analysis**:
- If they accepted immediately, your offer was very good FOR THEM
- You likely left value on the table
- Could have gotten better deal

**LESSON**: Don't open with your best offer

**What to Do Now**:
- Nothing (deal is done)
- NEXT TIME: Open more ambitiously

**Example**:
- You offered: 5nm, 1 escort, 12h notice, 8h embargo
- They accepted immediately
- **Probably**: You could have gotten 4nm or 2 escorts
- **Next time**: Start with 4nm and 2 escorts, negotiate from there

---

**Q: How do I balance my party's interests with getting agreement?**

**A**:
**Key Insight**: Getting an agreement means BOTH parties must be satisfied enough

**Balance**:
- **Too focused on yourself**: Utility 0.80, but so one-sided other party rejects
- **Too focused on agreement**: Accept utility 0.35 just to get deal (below BATNA!)
- **BALANCED**: Target utility 0.55-0.65, ensure deal is feasible

**Framework**:
1. Prioritize YOUR must-haves (non-negotiable)
2. Be flexible on YOUR nice-to-haves (trading chips)
3. Recognize THEIR must-haves (make deal possible)
4. Find creative solutions (win-win where possible)

**Example** (Philippines):
- Your must-have: Standoff ≤5nm (operations)
- Your nice-to-have: 2 escorts (would prefer, 1 is ok)
- Their must-have: Some notification (control signal)
- Their nice-to-have: Longer embargo (face)
- **Solution**: 4.5nm standoff, 1 escort, 15h notification, 12h embargo
  - You got must-have (standoff ≤5nm)
  - You gave on nice-to-have (escorts)
  - They got must-have (notification)
  - They got nice-to-have (embargo)
  - **Result**: Both satisfied enough

---

### Understanding Metrics

**Q: Why is my acceptance probability different from my utility?**

**A**:
Risk attitude!

**Your Utility**: 0.60 (objective value)
**Your Acceptance**: 72% (subjective likelihood)

**If You're Risk-Averse** (Philippines):
- You prefer certainty
- Accept more readily than utility suggests
- Acceptance > Utility

**If You're Risk-Seeking** (China):
- You can wait for better
- Accept less readily than utility suggests
- Acceptance ≤ Utility

**LESSON**: Risk attitude matters, not just utility

---

**Q: What's a "good" utility score?**

**A**:
**Depends on your BATNA!**

**Example 1**: Philippines BATNA = 0.25
- Utility 0.55 = GOOD (0.30 improvement over BATNA)
- Utility 0.65 = VERY GOOD (0.40 improvement)
- Utility 0.75 = EXCELLENT (0.50 improvement)

**Example 2**: Malaysia BATNA = 0.40
- Utility 0.55 = MARGINAL (only 0.15 improvement)
- Utility 0.65 = GOOD (0.25 improvement)
- Utility 0.75 = VERY GOOD (0.35 improvement)

**LESSON**: "Good" is relative to your BATNA, not absolute number

---

## Conclusion

### Key Takeaways

**1. Know Your BATNA**
- Everything is relative to your fallback option
- Don't accept below BATNA
- But don't be greedy if BATNA is bad

**2. Focus on Interests, Not Positions**
- Positions: What you say you want
- Interests: Why you want it
- Interests open creative solutions

**3. Understand Weights and Trade-Offs**
- Not all parameters matter equally
- Focus on high-weight parameters
- Trade on low-weight parameters

**4. Read the Signals**
- Watch facilitator comments
- Observe other party's behavior
- Pattern recognition matters

**5. Balance Ambition with Feasibility**
- Too ambitious: Deal breaks
- Too flexible: Leave value on table
- Sweet spot: 0.55-0.65 utility

**6. Negotiate with Incomplete Information**
- You don't know other party's utility
- Must infer from signals
- Manage uncertainty

**7. Culture and Framing Matter**
- How deal is presented as important as substance
- Help other party save face
- Language and narrative are strategic tools

---

### Final Advice

**For First-Time Participants**:
- Don't panic if first round goes poorly
- Negotiation is iterative (multiple rounds normal)
- Use your strategy notes (Tab 4)
- Ask facilitator for clarification
- Focus on learning, not "winning"

**For Experienced Negotiators**:
- Simulation compresses time (hours not weeks)
- Quantified utilities are pedagogical tool (real life is murkier)
- Use this to test strategies in safe environment
- Observe your own biases and patterns

**For All**:
- This is learning environment
- Mistakes are ok (that's how you learn)
- Reflect after: What worked? What didn't?
- Apply insights to real-world negotiations

## Peace Context Information (V2 Enhancement)

### Overview

Version 2 of the SCS Mediation Simulation includes new peace mediation features that provide you with contextual information about the broader peace process. This information is available in the **"Peace Context" tab** in your participant interface.

**Why This Matters:**
- Real negotiations don't happen in a vacuum
- You need to understand escalation dynamics
- Domestic politics affects what you can accept
- Confidence-building measures can reduce tensions

This section explains what peace context information you can see and how to use it in your negotiation strategy.

---

### What You Can See

#### 1. Current Escalation Level (Read-Only)

**Location:** Peace Context tab → Current Escalation Level

**What It Shows:**
- Current crisis escalation level (1-9 scale)
- Visual indicator (green/yellow/red based on severity)
- Brief description of what this level means
- Assessed using advanced AI analysis of recent actions

**The 9-Level Escalation Ladder:**

The escalation levels are determined by an intelligent assessment system (LLM-powered) that analyzes proposed actions and classifies them:

1. **Level 1** (Green): Routine Operations - Normal patrols, fishing
2. **Level 2** (Green): Increased Presence - More frequent patrols
3. **Level 3** (Yellow): Close Encounters - Deliberate proximity, shadowing
4. **Level 4** (Yellow): Verbal Warnings - Radio challenges, threats
5. **Level 5** (Orange): Non-lethal Actions - Water cannons, ramming, blockades
6. **Level 6** (Orange): Detention/Seizure - Arresting crew, seizing vessels
7. **Level 7** (Red): Shows of Force - Military exercises, mobilization
8. **Level 8** (Red): Limited Engagement - Warning shots, disabling fire
9. **Level 9** (Red): Armed Conflict - Sustained combat operations

**How Escalation is Assessed:**

The instructor has access to an AI-powered escalation assessment tool that:
- Analyzes proposed actions using natural language understanding (Claude AI)
- Calculates escalation risk (0-100%) based on 70+ indicators
- Predicts likely counter-escalation responses (2-4 specific actions)
- Identifies "point of no return" thresholds
- Provides detailed reasoning for assessments

**How to Use This:**
- **Low Escalation (1-3):** Good foundation for negotiations; parties more willing to compromise
- **Moderate Escalation (4-6):** Tensions affect negotiations; focus on de-escalation measures first
- **High Escalation (7-9):** Crisis mode; urgent de-escalation needed before productive talks

**Example:**
```
Current Level: 5 - Non-lethal Actions
⚡ Moderate tension - manage carefully

Interpretation:
- Water cannon incidents have occurred
- Both sides on edge
- Need to include safety measures in any agreement
- Avoid proposals that could escalate further
- Consider proposing CBMs to reduce tensions
```

---

#### 2. Available Confidence-Building Measures (CBMs)

**Location:** Peace Context tab → Confidence-Building Measures Available

**What It Shows:**
- Top 5 recommended CBMs for current situation
- Each CBM includes:
  - Name and description
  - Trust-building value (0-1)
  - Implementation timeline

**CBM Categories:**
- **Communication:** Hotlines, protocols (ALWAYS useful)
- **Transparency:** Pre-notifications, information sharing
- **Constraints:** Voluntary restrictions, standoff distances
- **Verification:** Monitoring, joint fact-finding
- **Cooperation:** Joint activities, exercises

**How to Use This:**

**In Your Proposals:**
- Include 1-2 CBMs from the recommended list
- Shows good faith and reduces other side's security concerns
- Makes your proposal more attractive

**In Negotiations:**
- If other side seems defensive, propose communication CBMs
- If trust is low, start with transparency measures
- If incidents are occurring, propose constraint CBMs

**Strategic Tip:** CBMs are LOW-COST ways to make your proposal better without sacrificing core interests!

**Example:**
```
Recommended CBM: Maritime Incident Hotline
Description: 24/7 direct communication between coast guard command centers
Trust Building: 0.6/1.0
Timeline: 4 weeks

How You Could Use This:
"We propose including a 24/7 incident hotline in the agreement. This allows
both sides to de-escalate situations immediately, reduces accident risk, and
costs very little. It protects both our personnel."

Why This Helps:
- Shows you care about safety (builds trust)
- Reduces other side's fear of incidents
- Makes agreement more robust
- Doesn't compromise your core interests
```

**Common CBMs You'll See:**

1. **Maritime Incident Hotline** (Always recommended)
   - Benefit: Immediate crisis communication
   - Your angle: "Protects our personnel from misunderstandings"

2. **Pre-Notification of Activities** (Common)
   - Benefit: Reduces surprises and tensions
   - Your angle: "We'll notify them 12 hours before resupply - transparency builds trust"

3. **Standoff Distance Agreement** (If escalation ≥4)
   - Benefit: Reduces collision/ramming risk
   - Your angle: "Both sides stay 5nm apart during operations - safety first"

4. **CUES Protocol** (Naval operations)
   - Benefit: Standardized signals for vessel encounters
   - Your angle: "Use internationally recognized signals - prevents confusion"

5. **Joint Fact-Finding** (If trust ≥0.5)
   - Benefit: Shared understanding of incidents
   - Your angle: "Independent investigation prevents blame games"

---

#### 3. Your Domestic Political Constraints

**Location:** Peace Context tab → Your Domestic Political Constraints

**What It Shows:**
- Key political actors in your country
- Their positions and intensity
- Your "win-set size" (negotiation flexibility)
- Domestic red lines you cannot cross

**Understanding Win-Set Size:**
- **0.7-1.0:** High flexibility (many deals acceptable at home)
- **0.5-0.7:** Moderate flexibility (typical situation)
- **0.3-0.5:** Constrained (domestic pressure limits options)
- **0.0-0.3:** Highly constrained (few deals will be ratified)

**Your Domestic Actors (Examples):**

**If You're Philippines:**
1. **Fishermen** (Intensity: 0.9, Influence: 0.7)
   - Position: "Need guaranteed fishing access"
   - Red Line: Fisheries access must be ≥0.6
   - Impact: If agreement doesn't satisfy them, they'll block it

2. **Hardline Nationalists** (Intensity: 0.8, Influence: 0.6)
   - Position: "Must regain access to traditional grounds"
   - Red Line: Can't accept deal that looks like surrender
   - Impact: Will protest any weak-looking deal

3. **Military** (Intensity: 0.7, Influence: 0.8)
   - Position: "Cannot appear weak to China"
   - Red Line: Need sovereignty language that doesn't imply defeat
   - Impact: Can bureaucratically sabotage implementation

4. **Business Interests** (Intensity: 0.6, Influence: 0.5)
   - Position: "Avoid disrupting China trade"
   - Preference: Keep tensions low
   - Impact: Push for pragmatic compromises

**If You're China:**
1. **Hardline Nationalists** (Intensity: 0.9, Influence: 0.8)
   - Position: "Nine-dash line non-negotiable"
   - Red Line: Cannot make sovereignty concessions
   - Impact: Very powerful - can force government backtrack

2. **Military** (Intensity: 0.85, Influence: 0.9)
   - Position: "Maintain freedom of action"
   - Red Line: Cannot accept military restrictions
   - Impact: Most influential domestic actor

3. **Business Interests** (Intensity: 0.7, Influence: 0.6)
   - Position: "Need energy security and trade"
   - Preference: Pragmatic deals that secure resources
   - Impact: Push for economic solutions

**How to Use This Information:**

**Understanding Your Own Constraints:**
```
Example: Philippines with Win-Set 0.62

Situation: Offered deal with 40% fishing access

Check Constraints:
- Fishermen red line: Need ≥60% access
- Current offer: 40% access
- Result: CANNOT ACCEPT (fishermen will block)

Your Response:
"I understand your position, but my fishermen community - who are politically
powerful - need at least 60% access. If I accept 40%, this deal will be
rejected at home. Can we find a way to get to 60%?"

This is HONEST and STRATEGIC. You're not being difficult - you literally
can't sell this deal at home.
```

**Anticipating Other Side's Constraints:**
```
Example: China likely has hardliners who oppose ANY concessions

Your Strategy:
- Frame proposals as "practical arrangements" not "concessions"
- Give them face-saving language ("China's magnanimous gesture")
- Don't ask for explicit sovereignty concessions
- Accept ambiguous language if it lets both sides claim victory

Understanding their constraints makes you more effective!
```

**Strategic Implications:**

**When Your Win-Set is Small (0.3-0.5):**
- **Advantage:** Other side knows you can't give much → strengthens your position
- **Disadvantage:** Harder to find acceptable deals
- **Strategy:** Be transparent about constraints; propose creative solutions that satisfy domestic actors

**When Other Side's Win-Set is Small:**
- **Don't:** Push for concessions they literally cannot give
- **Do:** Help them find face-saving formulas
- **Remember:** They're not being stubborn - they have real domestic constraints

**Example Negotiation:**
```
Philippines: "We need 70% fishing access."

China: "We can't give that - our nationalists will call it surrender."

Philippines: "I understand. What if we frame it differently?
- We get 60% fishing access (satisfies my fishermen)
- Agreement says 'China permits humanitarian access' (your nationalists see
  China in control)
- We add media embargo for 12 hours (gives you time to frame it domestically)
- We publicly thank China for 'magnanimous gesture' (face-saving)

This way:
- I can sell it at home (60% ≥ my red line of 50%)
- You can sell it at home (framed as your choice, not concession)
- Both sides win"

This is win-win thinking informed by domestic constraints!
```

**Your Domestic Red Lines (If Shown):**

If win-set analysis identifies absolute deal-breakers, they'll appear as:
```
⛔ Hardline Nationalists: Must regain access to traditional fishing grounds
⛔ Fishermen: Need guaranteed fishing access ≥60%
```

**What This Means:**
- These are NON-NEGOTIABLE for you
- Any deal violating these WILL FAIL at home
- Be upfront about this - saves everyone time
- Focus negotiation on issues where you have flexibility

---

### How to Use Peace Context Information Strategically

#### Strategy 1: Propose De-Escalation Measures

**When:** Escalation level is ≥4 (moderate-high)

**How:**
1. Note current escalation level in Peace Context tab
2. Identify 1-2 recommended CBMs
3. Include them in your proposal:
   - "Given recent incidents, we propose adding a maritime incident hotline..."
   - "To reduce collision risk, let's agree to 5nm standoff distance..."

**Why It Works:**
- Shows you're concerned about safety (builds trust)
- Makes other side feel more secure
- Improves chances they'll accept YOUR core demands

**Example:**
```
"Look, we're at escalation level 5 - water cannons have been used. This is
dangerous for everyone. How about we add:
1. 24/7 incident hotline (so we can de-escalate immediately)
2. 5nm standoff distance (reduce physical confrontation risk)
3. Pre-notification 12 hours before operations (no surprises)

These protect BOTH our personnel. I think we can agree on safety even if we
disagree on other things. What do you think?"

This shows:
- You're reasonable (care about safety)
- You're not all-or-nothing
- You understand their concerns too
- You're building trust → makes them more likely to compromise on harder issues
```

---

#### Strategy 2: Explain Your Domestic Constraints

**When:** Other side demands something you can't give

**How:**
1. Check your Win-Set size and domestic actors in Peace Context tab
2. Identify which actor blocks their demand
3. Explain honestly:
   - "I understand why you want X, but here's my problem..."
   - "My [actor] community will block this if I don't get Y..."
   - "Can we find a way to satisfy both our domestic audiences?"

**Why It Works:**
- Makes your "no" credible (not just haggling)
- Shifts from adversarial to problem-solving
- Helps other side understand it's not personal

**Example:**
```
China: "You can only do resupply once per month."

Philippines: "I hear you, but I need to explain my constraint. My military
leadership - which has high domestic influence - sees the garrison as symbolizing
our sovereignty. If we can't resupply regularly, they'll say we're abandoning
it, and they'll block this deal. They could even overthrow it after we sign.

What if we do:
- Monthly scheduled resupply (your preference)
- Plus emergency resupply if needed (my military's minimum)
- We pre-notify you 24 hours in advance (transparency)
- We limit to 2 ships (reduces your concern about militarization)

Does that work for both our domestic situations?"

This is powerful because:
- You're honest about your constraints
- You're not asking China to "give in" - you're solving a mutual problem
- You propose a compromise that might work for both sides
```

#### Strategy 3: Anticipate Other Side's Domestic Pressures

**When:** Designing your proposal

**How:**
1. Consider what domestic pressures other side faces
2. Frame your proposal to help them sell it at home
3. Offer face-saving measures

**Example for China:**
```
You know China has powerful hardline nationalists who oppose any "concessions."

So when proposing fishing access, DON'T say:
❌ "China must allow Philippines fishing access" (sounds like China losing)

INSTEAD say:
✅ "China could permit humanitarian fishing access as a goodwill gesture"

Why this works:
- "Permit" implies China in control (face-saving)
- "Humanitarian" makes it sound reasonable (not defeat)
- "Goodwill gesture" frames as Chinese choice (not forced)
- Their hardliners can accept this framing

You get what you need (fishing access) AND you help them sell it at home!
```

**Example for Philippines:**
```
You know Philippines needs to show sovereignty and protect fishermen.

So when proposing restrictions, DON'T say:
❌ "Philippines must ask permission before resupply" (sounds like surrender)

INSTEAD say:
✅ "Philippines will provide 12-hour advance notification of resupply missions"

Why this works:
- "Notification" not "permission" (sovereignty-preserving)
- They still get certainty (your goal) but framed differently
- Their public can accept this

You get what you need (advance notice) AND you let them save face!
```

#### Strategy 4: Build Trust Through Small CBMs

**When:** Negotiations are tense or stuck

**How:**
1. Check CBM recommendations in Peace Context tab
2. Propose implementing 1-2 simple CBMs immediately
3. Show good faith through actions

**Why It Works:**
- Builds momentum when talks stalled
- Low-cost way to improve relationship
- Makes bigger compromises easier later

**Example:**
```
"I know we're stuck on the sovereignty language. How about we table that for
now and make progress where we can agree?

Looking at the recommended confidence-building measures, what if we immediately
implement:

1. Maritime Incident Hotline (4 weeks to set up)
   - This protects both our people
   - Shows we can work together
   - Builds trust

2. Monthly coast guard commander video call
   - Personal relationship helps
   - Address small issues before they become big
   - Creates communication channel

Let's do these NOW, even before we finish negotiating the full agreement. It
shows good faith and makes our personnel safer immediately.

Then we come back to the sovereignty language with more trust. Deal?"

This works because:
- You're taking initiative (looks good)
- You're focused on safety (reasonable)
- You're building trust that makes final deal easier
- You show flexibility (makes them more likely to reciprocate)
```

### Common Questions

**Q: Should I tell the other side about my domestic constraints?**
A: Generally YES, but strategically:
- **Do:** Be honest about genuine red lines (saves time)
- **Don't:** Use it as excuse for every demand
- **Be Specific:** "My fishermen need 60%" is credible; "I need everything" is not

**Q: Can I see the other side's domestic constraints?**
A: No - just like real life! You have to infer from:
- What they say
- What they emphasize
- Where they won't budge
- Public information about their politics

**Q: What if my domestic red line is unrealistic?**
A: Then you may not reach agreement - which mirrors real life. Options:
- Find creative solution that satisfies constraint differently
- Build package deal with compensations
- Accept that some conflicts don't have solutions (BATNA)

**Q: Should I propose lots of CBMs?**
A: Quality over quantity:
- 1-3 well-chosen CBMs in initial proposal
- Match to current situation (escalation level, trust level)
- Don't overload - keep proposal simple

**Q: What if escalation level is already high (7+)?**
A: Focus FIRST on de-escalation:
- Propose immediate confidence-building measures
- Maybe even cease-fire or cooling-off period
- Hard to negotiate productively in crisis mode

---

### Practical Examples

#### Example 1: Using Escalation Information

```
Situation:
- Current Escalation: Level 6 (Detention/Seizure)
- A Filipino fishing boat was detained yesterday
- Tensions are very high

Your Approach (Philippines):
"Before we discuss the main agreement terms, I need to address the current
crisis. We're at escalation level 6 - our fishermen are being detained. This
makes it very hard for me to negotiate, and my public is demanding response.

I propose:
1. Immediate release of detained fishermen (de-escalates)
2. Establish incident hotline within 1 week (prevents future incidents)
3. Temporary standoff agreement while we negotiate (safety buffer)

This brings us down to level 4-5 where we can actually negotiate productively.
If we stay at level 6, my hardliners will force me to walk away. Let's de-
escalate first, then solve the bigger issues. Deal?"

Why This Works:
- Acknowledges current crisis (realistic)
- Proposes concrete de-escalation steps
- Explains why it matters (domestic pressure)
- Offers path forward
```

#### Example 2: Using Domestic Constraints

```
Situation:
- Your Win-Set: 0.55 (moderate flexibility)
- Key Constraint: Fishermen need ≥60% access (intensity 0.9, influence 0.7)
- China offers: 45% access

Your Response:
"Thank you for the offer of 45% fishing access. I appreciate you're trying to
find middle ground. But I need to be honest about my domestic constraint.

My fishing community - which is very powerful politically - has a red line of
60% access minimum. If I bring home a deal with only 45%, they will block it
in Congress. It's not that I don't want to compromise - I literally cannot
sell this at home.

Here's my counter-proposal:
- 60% fishing access (satisfies my fishermen)
- But we add 24-hour pre-notification (addresses your security concerns)
- And limit to traditional small-scale fishing only (no industrial boats)
- Plus we publicly thank China for humanitarian gesture (face-saving)

This gets me over my 60% threshold while addressing your concerns about
control and security. Can this work?"

Why This Works:
- Honest about constraint (credible)
- Not asking for 100% (shows flexibility where you have it)
- Offers trade-offs (notification, limits) to make it easier for them
- Helps them frame it domestically (face-saving)
```

#### Example 3: Using CBM Recommendations

```
Situation:
- Peace Context shows: "Maritime Incident Hotline" as top recommendation
- Trust Building: 0.6, Risk Reduction: 0.7, Cost: Low
- Current trust between parties is low (0.3)

Your Proposal:
"I'd like to propose we include a 24/7 Maritime Incident Hotline in our
agreement. Looking at the recommended confidence-building measures, this is
rated highly for both trust-building and risk reduction.

Here's why it makes sense:
- If an incident occurs, we can de-escalate immediately (risk reduction 0.7)
- Shows both sides committed to avoiding conflict (trust building 0.6)
- Very low cost - just phone lines and trained operators
- Can be operational in 4 weeks

This protects both our personnel and helps us implement the larger agreement
successfully. I think we can both agree that preventing incidents is in
everyone's interest, right?"

Why This Works:
- Cites specific recommendations (shows you did homework)
- Quantifies benefits (risk reduction, trust building)
- Notes low cost (easy to agree)
- Frames as mutual benefit (not zero-sum)
- Easy "yes" that builds momentum
```

---

### Summary

The Peace Context information in your participant interface gives you three powerful tools:

1. **Escalation Level:** Understand current crisis dynamics and when de-escalation is needed
2. **CBM Recommendations:** Low-cost ways to make your proposals more attractive and build trust
3. **Domestic Constraints:** Understand your own red lines and negotiate honestly about them

**Use this information to:**
- ✅ Propose realistic deals that can actually be ratified
- ✅ Build trust through confidence-building measures
- ✅ Explain your constraints credibly
- ✅ Anticipate other side's domestic pressures
- ✅ De-escalate tensions when needed

**Remember:** Peace mediation is not just about agreement terms - it's about:
- Managing escalation dynamics
- Building trust over time
- Understanding domestic politics
- Creating sustainable peace

These tools help you do that!

## Scenario-Specific Negotiation Guidance (V2 Enhancement)

### Overview

Version 2 now provides scenario-aware guidance that adapts to the specific South China Sea flashpoint you're negotiating. Each of the four scenarios has unique dynamics, priorities, and challenges that affect your negotiation strategy.

**Why This Matters:**
- Different scenarios prioritize different issues (resupply vs. fishing vs. energy)
- Domestic constraints vary by scenario context
- Optimal strategies change based on the dispute type
- Peace mediation recommendations are scenario-specific

This section helps you understand how to adjust your approach for each scenario.

- Cannot give: Standoff >5 nm (makes resupply unsafe), zero escorts (vulnerable)

Framing:
- "We're conducting routine operations in our EEZ under international law"
- "Pre-notification demonstrates transparency and reduces tensions"
- "Safety measures protect both our personnel and yours"
```

**CBMs to Propose:**
1. **Maritime Incident Hotline** (trust: 0.6, immediate need)
2. **CUES Distance Protocol** (trust: 0.5, reduces collisions)

**Scenario-Specific Strategy:**
```
Opening Position:
- Standoff: 6-7 nm (maintains distance posture)
- Escorts: 0-1 vessel (minimize militarization)
- Notification: 24-48 hours (emphasize Chinese control)
- Framing: "Humanitarian access subject to notification"

Concession Strategy:
- Can give: Shorter standoff IF more notification time, 24/7 hotline (you benefit too)
- Cannot give: Language acknowledging PH sovereignty, zero notification (lose control narrative)

Framing:
- "China permits humanitarian resupply as magnanimous gesture"
- "Notification ensures maritime safety and prevents misunderstandings"
- "Cooperation demonstrates China's responsible great power role"
```

**CBMs to Propose:**
1. **Notification Protocol** (you control narrative - "they ask permission")
2. **Media Embargo** (gives you time to frame domestically)
3. **Safety Monitoring** (shows responsible approach)

- Coastal Communities: Economic survival at stake (intensity: 0.9, influence: 0.7)
- Nationalists: Remember 2012 "betrayal" - trust China is low

**Scenario-Specific Strategy:**
```
Opening Position:
- Fishing Access: 70% (room to negotiate down to 60%)
- Monitoring: Joint observer program (reduces he-said-she-said)
- Safety: Fishermen protection protocols, emergency assistance
- Framing: "Traditional fishing grounds, livelihoods not politics"

Concession Strategy:
- Can give: Lower % IF alternating zones (gets you time), seasonal adjustments
- Cannot give: Below 60% access (fishermen will block deal)

Creative Solutions:
- Alternating zones: Week 1 in Zone A, Week 2 in Zone B (both sides fish, just not simultaneously)
- Joint marine resource survey (creates shared knowledge, builds trust)
- Fishermen-to-fishermen dialogue (Track 2 diplomacy)
```

**CBMs to Propose:**
1. **Fishermen Emergency Assistance Protocol** (trust: 0.8, humanitarian)
2. **Joint Marine Resource Survey** (trust: 0.6, shared interests)

**Scenario-Specific Strategy:**
```
Opening Position:
- Fishing Access: Limited (30-40% for PH)
- Monitoring: Chinese coast guard (maintain control narrative)
- Framing: "China permits controlled access in Chinese waters"

Concession Strategy:
- Can give: Higher access % IF proper notification, alternating zones (you still control timing)
- Cannot give: "Shared waters" language (undermines 2012 position)

Face-Saving Framing:
- "China grants fishing permits in designated zones"
- "Chinese coast guard ensures safety and resource management"
- "Humanitarian consideration for traditional small-scale fishing"
```

**CBMs to Propose:**
1. **Fishing Permit System** (you issue permits = control narrative)
2. **Resource Management Cooperation** (joint interests in sustainability)
3. **Safety Monitoring** (coast guard as "protectors")

- Public: Less fired up than PH, but principles matter
- Regional: ASEAN watching (precedent implications)

**Scenario-Specific Strategy:**
```
Opening Position:
- EEZ Recognition: Functional acknowledgment (China respects Indonesian EEZ)
- Fishing Permits: China can apply for permits (you control access)
- Hot Pursuit: Indonesian coast guard can enforce in own EEZ
- Framing: "Legal EEZ management, not territorial dispute"

Concession Strategy:
- Can give: Fishing permits (Chinese fishermen can fish, just legally)
- Can give: Notification protocols (transparency, not permission)
- Cannot give: EEZ principles, enforcement rights

Creative Solutions:
- Permit system (Chinese fishing allowed, but under Indonesian law)
- Joint enforcement against illegal fishing (both benefit from sustainability)
- Cooperation on marine resources (shared economic interests)
```

**CBMs to Propose:**
1. **Fishing Permit System** (trust: 0.7, legal framework)

- Fishing Interests/Militia: Want free access (intensity: 0.8, influence: 0.7)
- Foreign Ministry: Balance with Indonesia relations (complexity)

**Scenario-Specific Strategy:**
```
Opening Position:
- Sovereignty: Maintain nine-dash line exists formally
- Practical: Can accept Indonesian EEZ management without formal recognition
- Fishing: Want continued access for fleet

Concession Strategy:
- Can give: Permit system (fishing continues, just with paperwork)
- Can give: Notification (if it doesn't limit access)
- Cannot give: Formal nine-dash line abandonment (domestic backlash)

Face-Saving Framing:
- "China and Indonesia cooperate on fisheries management"
- "Permits are administrative cooperation, not sovereignty concession"
- "Pragmatic arrangement for mutual benefit"
```

**Creative Solutions:**
- Accept permit system (fishing continues, Indonesia asserts EEZ)
- Enforcement cooperation (both combat IUU fishing)
- Separate sovereignty claims from EEZ management (pragmatic)

### How to Use Scenario-Specific Guidance

#### Before Negotiation

**1. Read Your Scenario Brief**
- Understand the flashpoint context
- Know the history (e.g., 2012 Scarborough incident affects trust)
- Identify unique features (energy vs. fishing vs. sovereignty)

**2. Review Your Domestic Constraints**
- Check Peace Context tab for your specific constraints in THIS scenario
- Note red lines (non-negotiable)
- Identify flexibility areas

**3. Study Recommended CBMs**
- See which confidence-building measures recommended for THIS scenario
- Note trust-building values
- Plan to propose 1-2 in your offer

#### During Negotiation

**1. Use Scenario-Appropriate Language**

**Scenario A (Resupply):** Military/operational terms
- "Safe operational access"
- "Personnel safety protocols"
- "Routine resupply procedures"

**Scenario B (Fishing):** Economic/humanitarian terms
- "Traditional fishing grounds"
- "Fishermen livelihoods"
- "Sustainable resource management"

**Scenario C (Energy):** Commercial/technical terms
- "Operational certainty"
- "Technical cooperation"
- "Joint development framework"

**Scenario D (EEZ):** Legal/principled terms
- "UNCLOS EEZ rights"
- "Fisheries management"
- "Legal enforcement cooperation"

**2. Reference Scenario-Specific Examples**

**Good:**
- "In 2014, water cannon attacks injured our sailors - we need safety protocols" (Scenario A)
- "After 2012, trust is low - we need third-party monitoring" (Scenario B)
- "Petronas has invested $2B already - we need operational certainty" (Scenario C)
- "Indonesia's EEZ is undisputed under UNCLOS - permits respect that" (Scenario D)

**Bad:**
- Generic arguments that don't connect to scenario context

**3. Adapt Your Proposals**

**Don't use one-size-fits-all:**
- Scenario A priorities ≠ Scenario B priorities
- Resupply standoff distance ≠ Fishing zone access %
- Each scenario has different optimal parameters

**Do tailor your offers:**
```
Scenario A: Focus on standoff distance, escort count, notification time
Scenario B: Focus on fishing access %, monitoring type, alternating zones
Scenario C: Focus on operational zones, revenue share, joint development
Scenario D: Focus on permit system, enforcement rights, EEZ recognition
```

#### After Evaluation

**1. Check Scenario-Specific Metrics**
- Your utility is calculated based on THIS scenario's weights
- Comparison only valid WITHIN scenario, not across scenarios

**2. Use Peace Context Information**
- Escalation level specific to this scenario
- CBM recommendations tailored to these dynamics
- Domestic constraints reflect this dispute context

**3. Adjust Based on Feedback**
- If utility low, check which scenario-specific parameters matter most
- Prioritize high-weight issues for this scenario
- Use scenario-appropriate trade-offs

---

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Mistake 1: Using Wrong Parameter Focus**
```
Bad: Proposing resupply terms in fishing scenario
Bad: Emphasizing fishing access in energy scenario
Good: Match your proposals to scenario focus
```

**Mistake 2: Ignoring Scenario Context**
```
Bad: "Trust China" in Scenario B (after 2012 deception)
Good: "Third-party monitoring given 2012 experience" (acknowledges context)
```

**Mistake 3: One-Size-Fits-All Strategy**
```
Bad: Same opening position across all scenarios
Good: Adapt priorities to what matters in THIS scenario
```

**Mistake 4: Wrong Domestic Constraints**
```
Bad: Citing military concerns in commercial energy scenario
Good: Cite business/Petronas concerns in energy scenario
```

**Mistake 5: Inappropriate CBMs**
```
Bad: Military confidence-building in fishing livelihood scenario
Good: Fishermen dialogue and community CBMs in fishing scenario
```
